A casualty without a clear airway or who is not \\nbreathing may die from lack of oxygen. Excessive loss of blood \\nmay lead to shock, and shock can lead to death; therefore, you \\nmust act immediately to control the loss of blood. All wounds \\nare considered to be contaminated, since infection-producing \\norganism (germs) are always present on the skin and clothing, \\nand in the soil, water, and air. Any missile or instrument (such \\nas bullet, shrapnel, knife, or bayonet) causing a wound pushes \\nor carries germs into that wound. Infection results as these \\norganism multiply. That a wound is contaminated does not \\nlessen the importance of protecting it from further as soon as \\npossible to prevent further contamination\\nOPEN THE AIRW AY AND RESTORE BREATHING\\n When a victim is unconscious, all muscles are relaxed. \\nIf the victim is left on the back, the tongue, which is attached \\nto the back of the jaw, falls against the back wall of the throat \\nand blocks air from entering the lungs. Other soft tissues \\nof the airway may worsen this obstruction. The mouth falls \\nopen but this tend to block, rather than open, the airway. The \\nunconscious victim is further a risk because of being unable \\nto swallow or cough out foreign material in the airway. This \\nmay cause airway obstruction, or laryngeal irritation and \\nforeign material may enter the lungs. For this reason the \\nrescuer should not given an unconscious victim anything by \\nmouth, and should not attempt to induce vomiting.\\nKey point:\\n In an unconscious victim, care of the airway takes \\nprecedence over any injury, including the possibilities of \\nspinal injury. Airway management is high priority. It is \\nimportant to check the airway before the breathing. If air \\ncannot enter the lungs due to some sort of blockage, the \\ncasualty will not survive for long.\\nAirway management is required to provide an open \\nairway when the victim:\\n l Is unconscious;\\n l Has an obstructed airway;\\n l Needs rescue breathing.\\nAlways obstruction:\\nIf during resuscitation the airway becomes \\ncompromised, the victim should be promptly rolled onto'),\n",

The victim should then be \\nreassessed for responsiveness and normal breathing. Most \\nairway problems are caused by the tongue and/or vomit. \\nThese can often be resolved by simple airway management.\\nTong u e:\\nThe muscle tone of the upper airway is directly \\nrelated to the responsiveness: when sleeping, for example; \\nminor degree of reduced muscle tone may lead to sufficient \\nobstruction to cause snoring. When unresponsive, however, \\nthis obstruction can become complete and fatal.\\nVomit:\\nFoot remains in our stomach for hours, so most \\nvictims will have food in their stomachs, and it is possible \\nfor this food to regurgitate up from the stomach into the \\nlungs. This is called aspiration. The acidity of the stomach \\ncontents and the particles size can block and damage the \\nairway. Regurgitation is a passive process caused by a rise \\nin stomach pressure overcoming the sphincter. It is usually \\ncaused by a full gut, obesity, (weight on the stomach) or air.\\nHow to check an Airway:\\n l Open the mouth and look for foreign objects\\n l Finger sweep (only if an object can be seen and can \\nremoved with a sweep of a gloved finger)\\n l Perform a “Head-tilt, chin-lift” .\\nHead-tilt, chin-lift:\\nAdults and children (a \\nchild is define as one \\nyear to eight years of \\nage).\\nOne hand is placed on \\nthe forehead or the top \\nof the head.

In severe \\ncases skin or appendages may be burned off.\\nTreatment\\n l First degree and second degree burns, only \\ncovering up to about 1% (like the size of a hand )\\nbody surfaces:\\n 1. Wash/soak burned portions in cold water\\n 2. Wash burned area in soapy water\\n 3. Place sterile gauze over burned area\\n 4. Bandage burned area snugly\\n l Large burn of any degree\\n1. If a doctor is available within 30 minutes or less\\n v Treat victim for shock\\n v Get victim to advanced medical treatment, attempt \\nno treatment\\n2. If advanced medical aid is not readily (like in an \\noutdoor/camping/backpacking setting):\\n v Remove clothing from burned area. Cut around \\nclothing/cloth that stick to burned area\\n v Apply antiseptic cream to burned area\\n v Cover burned area with sterile dressing\\n v Bandage snugly (not too tight however )\\n v Treat for shock\\n v If victim is conscious, allow them to drink all the \\nwater they desire. Commercially sport drinks are \\neven better than water if available\\n v Get victim as soon as possible to advanced medical \\nsupport'),\n",

REWORD PROF. DR. P. VANDEKERCKHOVE  \\n \\n  \\nDear reader of this Indian First Aid Manual,  \\n  \\nFirst aid techniques taught to people across the globe vary widely – or maybe it’s best to say: \\n‘used to vary widely’. The main reason for these different kinds of first aid manuals or guidelines \\nis the fact that they are not always based on scientific evi dence. This also means that they do \\nnot necessarily describe the most effective first aid techniques.   \\n  \\nThat is also the very reason why, in 2006, the Belgian Red Cross (Flanders) decided to harmonise \\nthe traditional European first aid guidelines and bas e them on research and international \\ndirectives.  As a result, the European First Aid Manual (EFAM), now in its second edition, was \\ncreated and updated using the latest medical and scientific information.   \\n  \\nSeveral African Red Cross Societies expressed their interest in a similar science-based first aid \\nmanual adapted to the African context. Belgian Red Cross (Flanders) helped to formulate these \\ncontextualised guidelines in 2009, resulting in the publication of the African First Aid Manual \\n(AFAM).   \\n  \\nThe development of the Indian First Aid Guidelines (IFAG) was the logical next step. IFAG was \\npublicised at the end of 2014.  These guidelines, combined with the most recent international \\nfirst aid guideline-recommendations (ILCOR 2015), formed the basis of the new Indian First Aid \\nManual (IFAM). The manual is used by St John Ambulance (India) and the Indian Red Cross \\nSociety.   \\n  \\nIFAM is available to more than 1.2 billion Indian laypeople meaning that all these people can \\nlearn the most recent, evidence-based first aid techniques adapted to the Indian way of life.  I \\nam convinced that, with IFAM and thanks to the efforts of the Indian Red Cross Society and St \\nJohn Ambulance (India), we can reduce the burden of injuries and diseases in India.  \\n  \\nI hope you enjoy reading and learning from this manual.'),\n",

S.P. AGARWAL \\n \\nFirst aid training is a low cost, but highly effective strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality.  \\nWith the help of Belgia n Red Cross Centre for Evidence -Based Practice (CEBaP), Belgian Red \\nCross-Flanders and a multi -disciplinary expert panel, Indian Red Cross Society prepared the \\nevidence-based Indian First Aid Guidelines (IFAG) in 2014 which were used to update the sixth \\nedition of first a id Manual prepared for the general public by the St. John Ambulance (India) \\nand the Indian Red Cross Society. \\nFirst aid has been practised in the world since antiquity. There is enough evidence that it was \\nused to give relief to the injured and sick persons in wars and calamities in India since the times \\nof Mahabarata. The use of first aid techniques expanded and improved with time, but it got \\nthe real fillip when the Red Cross Movement started in the world about 150 years ago. \\nConsequently, The Indian Red Cross Society was established in 1920 through an Act of the \\nParliament. Until then, the St. John Ambulance carried out Red Cross work in addition to its \\nnormal activities. \\nTo provide the right and effective help before a trained health worker is available or the victim \\nreaches a health facility, it needs to be given by the laypersons who happen to be present \\nwherever a person suffers from an injury or illness. This will only be possible when a large number \\nof laypeople are trained in evidence-based first aid techniques. Presently, about 6 lakh persons \\nare trained in India every year in the basic first aid. The number looks impressive, but is not \\nadequate considering the huge population and vast area not having good communication \\nfacilities. \\nThis seventh edition of the Indian First Aid Manual (IFAM) has several new and updated features. \\nA brief on anatomy and physiology has been provided on each system. The chapter on cardio \\npulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has been completely revised. More emphas is has been put on \\nchest compression to ensure improvement in the blood supply to heart and brain, and use of \\ndirect pressure to the site of bleeding to control further bleeding. A chapter on hand  washing \\nhas been added to prevent the transmission of infections between the victim and first aiders. \\nGuidelines related to snake bites have been totally revised considering the after effects of \\ntourniquet binding. Useful guidelines have been added for important public health problems \\nsuch as diarrhoea, fever, diabetes, emergency childbirth etc. which still claim many lives.  \\nI am convinced  the new Manual will be immensely useful for the laypersons as well as \\nhealthcare workers to understand the evidence -based techniques of first a id which are \\nbecoming more and  more crucial in saving life in this era when the country is facing an \\nepidemic of roadside accidents. \\n \\nDr. S.P.Agarwal \\nSecretary General \\nIndian Red Cross Society  \\nSt. John Ambulance (India)'),\n",

Being laymen in the field of medicine, \\nit is expected that they will practice the basic principles of first aid and render such aid needed \\nby the casualty (casualties) till medical aid arrives or the person(s) has (have) been transported \\nto the hospital. The basic characteristic of this manual is to make the layman competent in the \\nsubject. \\nThe first aid guidelines in this manual have been based on the latest available and accessible \\nscientific and medical knowledge. In 2014 , a team of Indian medical and first aid specialists \\npublicised the Indian Firs t Aid Guideli nes (IFAG) . These guidelines are developed using a \\nrigorous and transparent methodology to overcome potential biases; are based on extensive \\nresearch, data analysis and reviews; and are specifically adapted to be implemented within \\nthe Indian context.  The se guidelines are further complemented by the 2015 guidelines on \\nresuscitation and fi rst aid as published by International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation \\n(ILCOR) and the American Heart Association (AHA). The first aid guidelines and implementation \\nconsiderations compiled by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent \\nSocieties (IFRC) (2016) were deliberated . The editorial board reviewed the applicability of \\navailable first aid guidelines int o the specific Indian context and rephrased or adapted them \\naccordingly. For interventions w here neither IFAG nor international first aid g uidelines existed, \\nor in case sufficient or scientifically evidence was not available, the editorial board decided to \\ninclude the commonly applied first aid practices.  \\nIn the first chapter this manual specifies in detail what “first aid” is about and how to deal with \\nan emergency. It further includes basic first aid techniques the first aider should master, i.e. \\nobserving vital signs and consciousness; cardiopulmonary resusci tation (CPR); recovery \\nposition; the first assessment of a casualty, and the hand washing technique. \\nThe subsequent chapters describe a more in-depth first aid approach and techniques.  \\nThe structure of these chapters is: \\n\\uf0a7 Each chapter begins with a short overview of the anatomy and physiology.  \\n\\uf0a7 For specific situation or condition, a list of signs and symptoms a lay person may \\nobserve and recognize are included in the section ‘What do I see and enquire?’ \\n\\uf0a7 This section is immediately followed by ‘What do I do?’ listing a sequence of first \\naid guidelines and techniques appropriate for that situation or condition. \\nDrawings support the student/reader in understanding specific positions, \\ntechniques or signs.  \\nThe list of guidelines and techniques is completed with a section on ‘ When to \\nrefer the casualty to a healthcare facility?’. Please note all casualties should best \\nconsult a medical caregiver in all cases.  \\nIf (urgent) patient transport is required, this is indicated by       .   \\nIf the casualty normally does not require organized (ambulance) transport for \\nfurther treatment, it is marked with the sign      .  \\nHowever, depending on the specific situation, condition of the person and \\nseverity of the injury or sickness, (ambulance) transport or even urgent transport \\nmight be required: the first aider needs to consider all elements on when and \\nhow a casualty needs to seek further medical help. In case of doubt, it is always \\nbetter to arrange (urgent) transport to the healthcare facility for further medical \\ntreatment.'),\n",

If the reason is a disease or \\nillness, the term ‘sick person’ is used. \\nThe guidelines and instructions are intended to be applied on  both male and female \\ncasualties. To make the reading easier,  and instead of writing ‘he/she’ , we opted to use the \\npronoun ‘he’ meaning that the guideline or instruction is applicable both for male  and for \\nfemale victims. Only if the intervention is specifically applicable to females, we use ‘she’ in the \\ninstructions.  \\nThis manual is limited in describing  the guidelines, interventions and techniques in words and \\npictures only. To acquire  a practical knowledge  it is important to practice these  techniques \\nand specifically to practice  the basic first aid techniques ( e.g. cardiopulmonary resuscitation \\n(CPR), how to put a person into recovery position , etc.) frequently. First aid courses organized \\nby the Indian Red Cross Society and the St John Ambulance Ass ociation India are ideal \\nopportunities in achieving a clear insight in these techniques and allows to exercise the theory \\ninto practice via simulation and on dummies. \\nThe trained first aider is advised to refresh his first aid knowledge by reviewing the guidelines \\nand techniques regularly in this manual and to practice them very frequently.  \\nThe medical science is constantly in evolution. Newer scientific insights might have an influence \\non the approach of casualties by lay people and on the first aid guidelines and techniques. \\nThis manual is scheduled to be reviewed and updated every five years ; the next review is \\nscheduled in 2021.'),\n",

The guidelines are to be followed by hospita ls, police \\nand other authorities for the protection of Good Samaritans.  The Supreme C ourt approved \\nthese guidelines on 30 March 2016, making them law of the land and binding to all states. \\nFollowing guidelines are included (sub-selection of the guidelines): \\n1. A bystander or Good Samaritan, including an eyewitness of a road accident , may \\ntake an injured to the nearest hospital and should be allowed to leave immediately. \\nNo questions are to be asked. An eyewitness has to provide his address.  \\n2. The bys tander or Good Samaritan shall not be liable for any civil and criminal \\nliability. \\n3. A bystander or Good Samaritan who makes a phone call to inform the police or \\nemergency services for the person lying injured on the road cannot be compelled \\nto give his name  or personal details on the phone or in person. The disclosure of \\ncontact details of the Good Samaritan is to be voluntary. \\n4. The lack of response by a  doctor in an emergency pertaining to road accidents \\n(where he is expected to provide care) shall constitute ‘Professional Misconduct’. \\nB.2.2 DUTY OF GIVING CARE  \\nUsually, if a volunteer comes to the aid of an injured or sick person who is a stranger, the person \\ngiving the aid owes the stranger a duty of being reasonably careful.  \\nIn relation to the “duty of giving care”, there is currently (2015) no legal obligation for first aiders \\nto provide first aid in a general public context, not unless it's part of a job description. First aid \\nofficers in workplaces and school teachers have a duty of care. \\nOnce a first aider begins to provide first aid, a duty of care is established and the first aider then \\nhas an obligation to fulfil the duty of care.  \\nIf a road user is involved in an accident, there is a legal requirement to stay at the scene, assist \\nthe injured and report the incident to the police. \\nNot fulfilling a duty of giving care leaves the first aider open to questions of negligence. Whilst \\nthere is no law that forces anyone to treat a casualty this does not mean that one can simply \\nleave a casualty who you know is in d anger.  To do so may make you liable through your \\nomission to act.   If you are not happy to provide first aid there are several things you can and \\nshould do including (but not limited to):  \\n\\uf0a7 inform someone else, such as the police or the emergency services; \\n\\uf0a7 make the area around the casualty safe for yourself, others and the casualty; \\n\\uf0a7 monitor the casualty and/or find out what happened; and \\n\\uf0a7 comfort the casualty.\"),\n",

If the person is conscious, you \\nmust ask for his consent before commencing any first aid. If he refuses your help, stay nearby \\nand call the police and emergency services, who can then deal with the situation.  \\nIf the person is under 18, it is best to obtain c onsent from his parent or guardian if they are \\npresent. If they refuse your help, stay nearby and call the police and the emergency services, \\nwho can then deal with the situation. \\nIf the person is unconscious or unable to formally consent, his consent is inferred and you can \\nthen give the necessary first aid. \\nB.2.4 PRIVACY \\nIn any first aid situation, the first aider must take steps to assist the person to maintain personal \\nprivacy. This means things like, keeping crowds away, putting up a screen if necessary, and  \\ncovering any exposed body parts with blankets, or sheets, if available.  \\nThe first aider also needs to take steps to maintain confidentiality. This means not talking about \\nthe incident to other people, or answering questions from the media, unless you have  \\npermission from the person involved in the accident. \\nB.2.5 NEGLIGENCE  \\nIf a volunteer comes to the aid of an injured or sick person who is a stranger, the person giving \\nthe aid owes the stranger a duty of being reasonably careful.  \\nNot fulfilling, or breaking a duty of care leaves the first aider open to questions of negligence.  \\nIt is unlikely that a first aider would be sued as long as not practiced outside the parameters of \\nthe techniques taught at the first aid training.'),\n",

Make the area safe. \\n2. Evaluate the injured person’s condition. \\n3. Seek help. \\n4. Give first aid. \\nB.3.1 STEP 1: MAKE THE AREA SAFE \\nYour own safety should always come first.  \\nAs a first aider, you should: \\n\\uf0a7 try to find out what has just happened; \\n\\uf0a7 check for any danger (is there a threat from traffic, fire, electricity cables, etc.?); \\n\\uf0a7 never approach the scene of an accident if you are putting yourself in danger; \\n\\uf0a7 do your best to protect both the injured person(s) and other people on the scene; \\n\\uf0a7 be aware that the property of the injured person is at risk. Theft can occur. So mind \\nyour safety, and \\n\\uf0a7 seek police or emergency help if an accident scene is unsafe and you cannot offer \\nhelp without putting yourself in danger. \\nAn important part of safety also includes washing your hands and wearing gloves or \\na protection when coming in contact with the injured or sick person’s blood or body \\nfluids.  \\nIn case of road accidents, as a first aider, you should: \\n\\uf0a7 always follow the traffic rules; \\n\\uf0a7 ask other people to warn traffic about the event; \\n\\uf0a7 if possible, place a warning sign at a good distance, at least 30 meters to either side \\nof the accident, to warn traffic. Do not forget to remo ve the warning signs \\nafterwards; \\n\\uf0a7 seek help from the police or emergency services; \\n\\uf0a7 not allow anybody to smoke near an accident site; \\n\\uf0a7 switch off the engine of every car involved in the accident; and'),\n",

You can also put something against the tyres to prevent rolling. \\n \\nAs a general rule, the injured person should not be moved from the scene of an accident. \\nAny movement may make the injury worse if there has been a head, neck, back, and leg or \\narm injury. \\nOnly move injured people if: \\n\\uf0a7 the injured person is in more danger if he is left there, \\n\\uf0a7 the situation cannot be made safe, \\n\\uf0a7 medical help will not arrive soon, and \\n\\uf0a7 you can do so without putting yourself in danger. \\nB.3.2 STEP 2: EVALUATE THE CONDITION OF THE SICK OR INJURED PERSON \\nIf it is safe, you can evaluate the sick  or injured person’s condition. Always check that he is \\nconscious and breathing normally. Situations in which consciousness or breathing are \\nimpaired are often life threatening.  \\nBleeding can also happen inside the body and can be life-threatening although the loss of \\nblood is not seen.  \\nTechniques of resuscitation (CPR), the recovery position, etc. are explained in this manual. \\nB.3.3 STEP 3: SEEK HELP \\n \\nOnce you have evaluated the sick  or injured person’s condition you can decide if help is \\nneeded urgently. \\nIf help is needed, ask a bystander to call for help. Ask him to come back and confirm that help \\nis underway.'),\n",

Always stay calm and answer their questions calmly. \\nThe call takers are professionals and will give you further guidance. \\nIf an ambulance can be obtained in a short time, it is best to call for one and use it to \\ntransport the injured or sick person to the healthcare facility. An ambulance is the best way \\nto transport ill or injured persons, but they are not always and everywhere quickly available. \\nYou can always ask the police for help. \\nIf no help is available, you will have to arrange transport yourself (in a van, a truck, a car, an \\nauto-rickshaw, a motorbike, a scooter, a bike-rickshaw, a bike...). Always move the sick  or \\ninjured person with great care. \\nB.3.4 STEP 4: PROVIDE FIRST AID \\nGive first aid in accordance with the instructions given in the following chapters in this manual. \\nWhen providing first aid, try to protect an ill or injured person from cold and heat. \\nDo not give anything to eat or drink to a person who is: \\n\\uf0a7 severely injured, \\n\\uf0a7 feeling nausea, \\n\\uf0a7 becoming sleepy, or  \\n\\uf0a7 falling unconscious. \\nIn fact, as a general principle, the rule is not to give a casualty anything to drink or \\neat. Important exceptions include hypothermia (low body temperature), \\nhypoglycaemic shock (low blood sugar in a diabetes patient) , diarrhoea and fever \\nleading to dehydration and in case of heat exhaustion or heatstroke; and only if the \\nperson is conscious .  The details can be reviewed in the specific  chapters on these \\nconditions.'),\n",

This will help to relax him; \\n\\uf0a7 listen to the person and show concern and kindness; \\n\\uf0a7 make him as comfortable as possible; \\n\\uf0a7 if he is worried, tell him that it is normal to be afraid; \\n\\uf0a7 if it is safe to do so, encourage family and loved ones to stay with him; and \\n\\uf0a7 explain to the sick or injured person what has happened and what is going to happen. \\nB.3.5 WHEN CAN I STOP PROVIDING FIRST  AID? \\nThe question arises when your first aid ‘duty’ comes to an end?  \\nWithin first aid, CPR is a lifesaving activity. But when you can stop giving CPR?  There are four \\nreasons allowing you to stop CPR: \\n\\uf0a7 you see a sign of life, such as breathing; \\n\\uf0a7 someone trained in first aid or a medical professional takes over;  \\n\\uf0a7 you are too exhausted to continue; or  \\n\\uf0a7 the scene becomes unsafe for you to continue.'),\n",

These chest compressions ensure a small but crucial supply of blood to \\nthe heart and brain.  \\nFor formally trained first aid providers (and professionals) treating an adult victim, compression \\nwith breaths is recommended. If the trained first aid provider is unable or unwilling, or in any \\nother circumstance, compression-only CPR may be substituted for compression with breaths. \\nFor babies and children under one year, compressions with breaths are always recommended. \\nB.5.1 WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE ? \\nIn case of a cardiac arrest (heart stops functioning) you might notice the following signs: \\n\\uf0a7 sudden collapse, \\n\\uf0a7 loss of consciousness, \\n\\uf0a7 no breathing, \\n\\uf0a7 no pulse (however, this is not always easy for laypeople to confirm). \\nB.5.1.1 HOW TO OBSERVE RESPONSIVENESS AND CONSCIOUSNESS? \\nUnconsciousness occurs when a person is suddenly unable to respond to stimuli like sound or \\npain, and appears to be asleep. A person may be unconscious for a few seconds (as is the \\ncase with fainting) or for longer periods of time.   \\nPeople who become unco nscious do not respond to loud sounds or shaking. They may even \\nstop breathing or their pulse may become faint. This calls for immediate emergency attention. \\nThe sooner the person receives emergency first aid, the better it is. \\nThe AVPU scale (an acronym from \"alert, voice, pain, unresponsiveness\") is a system by which \\na first aider can measure and record a person\\'s responsiveness, indicating the level of \\nconsciousness. It is based on the casualty’s eye opening, verbal and movement (motor) \\nresponses.  \\nThe AVPU scale has only four possible outcomes: \\n\\uf0a7 A – Alert.  \\nThe person is fully awake (although not necessarily oriented). The person will spontaneously \\nopen eyes, will respond to voice (although may be confused) and will have bodily motor \\nfunction.'),\n",

It could be opening his \\neyes, responding to your questions or initiating a move. These responses could be as little \\nas a grunt, moan, or slight movement of a limb when prompted by the voice of the rescuer. \\n\\uf0a7 P – Responding to pain. \\nThe person makes a response of any kind  on the application of pain stimulus , such as a \\ncentral pain stimulus like a  rub on his breastbone or a peripheral stimulus such as squeezing \\nhis fingers.  \\nPersons with some level of consciousness (a fully conscious person would not require any \\npain stimuli) may respond by using their voice, moving their eyes, or moving part of their \\nbody (including abnormal posturing). \\n\\uf0a7 U - Unresponsiveness also noted as 'Unconsciousness'. \\n \\nThis outcome is recorded if the person does not give any eye, voice or motor response to \\nvoice or pain. \\nTo check a person’s responsiveness/consciousness state check the following: \\n1. A person who looks around, speaks, responds clearly to questions, feels touch and \\nmoves or walks around, is considered alert (A). \\n2. The person opens his eyes and responds to simple questions: \\n\\uf0a7 “What is your name?” \\n\\uf0a7 “Where do you live?” \\n\\uf0a7 “How old are you?” \\nThe person responds to simple commands: \\n\\uf0a7 “Squeeze my hand.” \\n\\uf0a7 “Move your arm/leg/foot/hand.” \\nIf the person responds, he is responsive to voice (V). \\n3. If there is still no response, pinch the person and see if he opens his eyes or moves. \\n  If the person responds to pain, he is responsive to pain (P). \\nIf the person does not react to any of these stimuli, he is in an unconscious state (U).  \\nNote that a person might only  partially respond to the stimuli you provide (sound, touch, \\npain) and might be in an in-between (groggy) state.\"),\n",

Every time we breathe in, air containing oxygen enters the lungs. \\nWhen we breathe out  air containing waste products is removed from the lungs. In each \\ninspiration we take approximately 500 cc of air in.  \\nRespiration is defined as the transport of oxygen from the outside air to the cells within the body \\ntissues, and the transport of carbon dioxide (a waste product) in the opposite direction.  \\nC.1.1 THE RESPIRATORY SYSTE M \\n \\nC.1.1.1 THE AIR PASSAGES \\nThe air passages  consist of the nose, throat (pharynx), wind pipe (trachea) and air -tubes \\n(bronchi). The bronchi divide into min ute branches (bronchioles) which end in the lung \\nsubstance (alveoli). \\nC.1.1.2 THE LUNGS \\nThe lungs (two in number) are situated on the right and left sides of the chest cavity. Each lung \\nis made up of a number of small sacs, called alveoli. The lungs are covered by a membrane \\ncalled ‘pleura’ which lines the inner wall of the chest cavity.'),\n",

The ribs \\nmove upwards and forwards increasing the capacity of the chest cavity from front to back by \\nthe action of the muscles situated between the ribs; the lungs thus expand and air enters them. \\nThis is an active process. \\nDuring expiration (breathing out) the reverse process takes place. The diaphragm comes back \\nto its original state and the ribs fall back thus forcing the air out of the lungs. This is a passive \\nprocess. \\nSmall blood vessels (capillaries) surround the alveoli.  The exchanges of oxygen and carbon \\ndioxide take place through the blood circulating in these capillar ies. Oxygen is absorbed by \\nthe red blood corpuscles of the blood; water vapour and carbon dioxide are let out from the \\nblood plasma into the alveoli and expelled out. \\nThe lungs are also supplied with nerves which are connected to an area in the brain calle d \\nrespiratory centre. This centre controls the respiration.'),\n",

It then passes to \\nthe left lower chamber, called left ventricle, and from there, in the course of the beating of the \\nheart the purified blood is discharged into various blood vessels called arteries and capillaries \\nwhich convey this purified blood for the nourishment for the body as a whole  including the \\nheart muscles. Thus each heart is in fact two pumps put together. \\nD.1.2 BLOOD PRESSURE  \\nThe pressure in the arteries varies with the beating of the heart. When the heart contracts the \\npressure in the arterial system increases; when the heart relaxes, the pressure in the arter ies \\ndecreases. The pressure exerted on the main arteries is known as the blood pressure and is \\nrecorded by a blood pressure measuring instrument. \\nD.1.3 PULSE \\nWith each heartbeat blood is ejected into the arterial system. Most of the arteries are placed \\ndeep in the body except on the wrist, elbow, neck, groin and ankle. So arterial pulse is normally \\nfelt over the lateral side of the wrist, in the neck, temples, and groin and near the ankle. You \\nmay not be able to feel arteries even at these sites (except carotid a rtery in the neck which is \\na major artery near to the heart) when the person is in shock. Nevertheless, f eeling the pulse \\ncorrectly is not always easy and requires training.  \\nPulse rate in a normal resting adult is between 60 and 100 beats per minute.

The \\nremainder yellowish liquid portion of the blood is called plasma which contains \\nproteins, enzymes and other important ingredients. \\n\\uf0a7 Whenever blood comes in contact with some external material it  tends to solidify, \\nforming a clot to stop further bleeding. When the blood clots inside the arteries, \\nveins or the heart it is referred to as a thrombus. \\nD.1.5 HOW BLOOD CLOTS  \\nWhen a blood vessel is severed or damaged, it constricts (narrows) in order to prevent \\nexcessive amounts of blood from escaping.  At a first stage, specialized blood cells called \\nplatelets come into contact with the damaged vessel wall, become sticky and s tart to clump \\nat the site of the injury. \\nInjured tissue cells at the site of the wound together with the clumped platelets, trigger a series \\nof complex chemical reactions that result in the formation of a substance called fibrin. Strands \\n(filaments) of fib rin come together to form a mesh, which traps blood cells to make a blood \\nclot. The clot releases a pale -coloured fluid, called serum, which contains antibodies and \\nspecialised cells. The serum begins the process of repairing the damaged area. At first the  \\nblood clot is a jelly-like mass. Later it dries out into a crust (scab) that seals and protects the site \\nof the wound until the healing process is complete.'),\n",

If someone \\ncomplains of chest discomfort, it may be a sign that not enough blood is flowing to the heart \\nmuscles. This is very serious and can indicate that the person may suffer from a heart attack. \\nA heart attack happens when there is a blockage of the blood flow to some parts of the \\nheart muscle. In that case, a part of the heart muscle starts to die as soon as that region does \\nnot get any blood supply. It is serious even if the sick person says that nothing is wrong with \\nhim.  \\nWhen a person complains of chest pain, always suspect an impen ding heart attack. \\nHowever, not every chest discomfort or pain is a heart attack.

When a blood vessel is \\ndamaged, several mechanisms are activated to control blood loss: the vessel constricts, and \\na series of chemical reactions occur to form a blood clot as a “plug” over the damaged area. \\nIf blood vessels are torn or severed, uncontrolled blood loss may occur before clotting can take \\nplace, and shock may develop. \\nD.3.1 TYPES OF BLEEDING  \\nA bleeding can be classified by the type of the blood vessel that has been damaged: \\n\\uf0a7 Arterial bleeding. \\n \\nArteries carry bright red oxygen rich blood under pressure from the heart. If an artery is \\ndamaged, the bleeding may be profuse. The blood will spurt out of it in time with the \\nheartbeat. If a main artery is severed, the blood may jet several feet high. In this case, the \\nvolume of the circulating blood will fall rapidly.  \\n\\uf0a7 Venous bleeding. \\n \\nThe blood in the veins, having given up its oxygen into the tissues, is dark red. The blood \\nflows under less pressure than arterial blood, but the vein walls can widen greatly and the \\nblood can ‘pool’ inside them. If a major vein is damaged, the blood may gush from it \\nprofusely.'),\n",

Wounds can be external or internal in the body. Each type of wound carries \\nspecific risks associated with the surrounding tissue damage and infection. \\nDifferent types of wounds are:  \\n\\uf0a7 Abrasions \\n \\nAbrasions are superficial wounds in which the top most layers of the skin are scraped off, \\nleaving a raw, tender area. These wounds appear often when experiencing a sliding fall \\n(e.g. of a bike). The wounds often contain embedded foreign particles which may result \\nin infections. Abrasions do not bleed much, but are usually very painful. \\n\\uf0a7 Incisions \\n \\nIncised wounds  are caused by sharp instruments such as a knife, razor, etc. The blood \\nvessels show a straight cut and bleeding may be profuse. Other structures such as tendons \\nand nerves may be damaged too. \\n\\uf0a7 Contusions (bruises) \\n \\nContused wounds  are caused by blows , by blunt instruments or by punching. The \\ncapillaries are ruptured by the punch and blood leaks into the tissues. Severe contusion \\nmight be an indication of a deeper damage, like a fracture or internal injury.'),\n",

The edges are mostly irregular in shape. There is \\nusually more underlying tissue damage. These wounds are often contaminated with \\ngerms; the risk of infection is high.  This type of wound sometimes has less bleeding, but is \\nusually very painful. \\n\\uf0a7 Puncture wounds \\n \\nPuncture wounds  are caused by stabs or sharp instrument s like knifes, daggers or nails. \\nThese wounds typically have a smaller opening, but may reach deep into the tissue. These \\nmay not be very painful. \\n \\nA stab wound is a puncture wound by a knife or sharp blade.  \\nA gunshot wound is the wound caused by a bullet or missile driven into the body.

Germs are \\nbacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. \\nAn infection i s caused by germs getting into the body through the broken skin. The germs \\nmultiply in the wound and make it ‘infected’, also called as ‘ septic’. Germs may later get into \\nthe bloodstream and cause a septicaemia. \\nA wound is initially not infected, even though it may be contaminated by dirt or mat erials that \\ncontain germs. An infection occurs after a lapse of time when the germs have time to multiply \\nand invade the tissues. This time varies with the number of germs and their virulence and the \\nbody’s resistance to fight back. Pus formation is part of the body’s method to fight an infection. \\nThe prevention of infection is very important.

Other causes include a foreign object in the nose, infection, common \\ncold, allergies, high blood pressure, high altitude, a dry environment, alcohol abuse, disease \\nand the use of certain medication. \\nDuring a nosebleed, blood may flow from one or both nostrils. This flow may last from a few \\nseconds to several minutes. \\n \\nIn case of a nose bleed: \\n1. Ask the person to pinch his nose above the nostrils with index finger and thumb. Tell \\nthe injured person to breathe through the mouth.  Ask the injured person to lean \\nforward so that he does not swallow or breathe in blood.  Swallowing blood can \\nmake the person feel sick. \\n2. Pinch the nostrils for 10 to 15 minutes.  If necessary, pinch the injured person’s n ose \\nyourself.'),\n",

If the blood loss exceeds 1.2 litres \\n(this is about one -fifth of the normal blood volume of an adult), shock may occur. The \\nblood loss may occur due to external and/or internal bleedings.  \\nLoss of other body fluids can also result in shock. Conditions that cause heavy fluid losses \\ninclude diarrhoea, severe burns, etc.  \\n\\uf0a7 Cardiogenic shock \\nIn addition, shock may occur when an adequate volume of blood is available, but the \\nheart is unable to pump the blood around.  This problem can be due to severe heart \\ndiseases, heart attack or acute heart failure. \\n\\uf0a7 Other types of shock \\nOther causes of shock include overwhelming infections ( septic shock) , lack of certain \\nhormones, low blood sugar level ( hypoglycaemia) ( metabolic sh ock), under-cooling \\n(hypothermia), injuries to the respiratory track or lungs ( respiratory shock), severe allergic \\nreactions (anaphylactic shock), drug overdose or spinal cord injuries (neurogenic shock). \\nD.13.2 WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE ? \\nYou might observe following symptoms: \\n\\uf0a7 Initially: \\n\\uf0a7 rapid pulse; \\n\\uf0a7 pale looks; \\n\\uf0a7 cold clammy, sweaty skin. \\n\\uf0a7 As shock develops: \\n\\uf0a7 rapid, shallow breathing; \\n\\uf0a7 cold, clammy skin; \\n\\uf0a7 rapid, weak pulse; \\n\\uf0a7 dizziness or fainting; \\n\\uf0a7 weakness; \\n\\uf0a7 eyes appear to stare; \\n\\uf0a7 anxiety or agitation;'),\n",

Usually one side of the jaw is \\naffected; however, both sides might be fractured. In most cases, the fracture is an open \\n(compound) fracture as there is usually a wound inside the mouth also. \\nSpinal fractures can happen indirectly when landing on the feet or buttocks in a heavy fall, \\nwhen being thrown forward suddenly (like in a car accident during a collision) or when lifting a \\nvery heavy weight.  A whiplash injury is a specific n eck injury caused by a fast movement of \\nthe head forward and backwards (e.g. during a car collision).   \\nDirect spinal fractures can be caused by falling from a height on the back across a bar or a \\nfall of a heavy weight on the back (e.g. during an earthquake or landslide) \\nE.5.2 WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE ? \\nYou should suspect a potential serious injury if the person: \\n\\uf0a7 fell from a height greater than his own standing height; \\n\\uf0a7 was involved in a road accident and suffered a hard blow; \\n\\uf0a7 is feeling nausea or is vomiting (throwing-up); \\n\\uf0a7 does not remember exactly what has happened; \\n\\uf0a7 is behaving in an irritated or unusual way after the accident; \\n\\uf0a7 complains of blurring vision; \\n\\uf0a7 feels pain or tenderness in the head, neck or back; \\n\\uf0a7 has serious wounds or injuries to the head; \\n\\uf0a7 has serious injuries on the legs and does not complain about pain; \\n\\uf0a7 feels like he has been cut in half; \\n\\uf0a7 is sleepy, drowsy or loses (has lost) consciousness; \\n\\uf0a7 has a fit; or \\n\\uf0a7 has an unequal pupil size. \\nBlood and brain fluid (CSF) may flow from the ear and/or nose in case of fracture of base of \\nskull.'),\n",

The cord runs through the spinal column. \\nThe main function of the spinal cord is to convey signals between the brain and the peripheral \\nnervous system. \\nF.1.2 THE PERIPHERAL NERVOU S SYSTEM (PNS) \\nThe peripheral nerves emerge in pairs, each containing motor and sensory nerves, from the \\nbrain and spinal cord. Sensory nerves transmit impressions received by the senses (sight, \\nhearing, touch etc.) to the brain and motor nerves then transmit the ‘orders’ given by the brain \\nto the voluntary muscles. When a nerve is cut there is a loss of feeling, power and movement \\nin that part of the body which is controlled by that nerve. \\nThe peripheral nervous system can be divided in voluntary or somatic nervous system and an \\nautonomic nervous system.  \\nF.1.2.1 THE SOMATIC NERVOUS SYSTEM \\nThe somatic system is the part of the  peripheral nervous system that is responsible for carrying \\nmotor and sensory information both to and from the central nervous system. This system is made \\nup of nerves that connect to the skin, sensory organs and all skeletal muscles. The system is \\nresponsible for nearly all voluntary muscle movements as well as for pro cessing sensory \\ninformation that arrives via external stimuli including hearing, touch and sight.  \\nF.1.2.2 THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM \\nThe autonomic nervous system is the part of the peripheral nervous system that regulates key \\ninvoluntary functions of the body. This system is not controlled by the will and acts continuously \\nwhether a person is awake or asleep. It controls different body functions  including the activity \\nof the heart muscle; the smooth muscles, including the muscles of the intestinal tract; and the \\nglands. The autonomic nervous system has two divisions: the sympathetic nervous system, \\nwhich accelerates the heart rate, constricts blood vessels, and raises blood pressure, and \\nthe parasympathetic nervous system, which slows the heart rate, increases intestinal and gland \\nactivity, and relaxes sphincter muscles.'),\n",

A person has perhaps lost \\nconsciousness if he does not react to your action by opening his eyes or answering your \\nquestions.  \\nThere is no absolute dividing line between consciousness and un- consciousness. People \\ncan be fully conscious (aware and awake) or fully unconscious (no reaction to any stimulus) \\nor at any level between these two extremes. \\nLoss of consciousness causes the muscles to relax.  During the period of \\nunconsciousness the tongue might fall backwards and block the breathing passage. \\nIn fainting, the unconscious state is usually brief as in vasovagal syncope.  Fainting can occur \\ndue to various reasons such as emotional distress, tiredness, hunger, standing up for long \\nperiod, a sudden change in body position, being a long time in a hot environment, or \\nspecific medical conditions. Pregnant women, children and the elderly can be more \\nvulnerable to these causes. \\nLonger periods of unconsciousness are more serious. Causes include head injuries, cardiac \\narrest, stroke or poisoning. \\nIn an unconscious state, the person will be unresponsive to your activities (touching, sounds \\nor other stimulation). \\nCheck the following: \\n\\uf0a7 Whether the person opens his eyes and responds to simple questions: \\n\\uf0a7 “What is your name?” \\n\\uf0a7 “Where do you live?” \\n\\uf0a7 “How old are you?” \\n\\uf0a7 Whether the person responds to simple commands: \\n\\uf0a7 “Squeeze my hand.” \\n\\uf0a7 “Move your arm/leg/foot/hand.” \\n\\uf0a7 If there is no response, pinch the person and see if he opens his eyes or moves. \\nIf the person does not react to any of these stimuli, he is in an unconscious state.  \\nNote that a person might only  partially respond to the stimuli  you provide (sound, \\ntouch, pain); he might be in an in-between state. \\nWhen the person becomes conscious again after a period of unconsciousness, he might \\nsuffer from: \\n\\uf0a7 confusion, \\n\\uf0a7 drowsiness, \\n\\uf0a7 light-headedness, \\n\\uf0a7 headache, \\n\\uf0a7 loss of bowel and bladder control (incontinence),'),\n",

All head \\ninjuries are potentially serious and require a proper assessment because they can impair \\nconsciousness.  \\nHead injuries can be associated with damage to the brain tissue itself, damage to blood vessels \\ninside the skull, skull fractures, brain concu ssions, and compression of brain tissue because of \\nbuilt up pressure due to swelling or bleeding. \\nAssume always that casualty suffering from head injury might also be having a neck or spinal \\ninjury. \\nF.3.1 CONCUSSION \\nA concussion is a ‘shake -up’ of the brain insi de the skull. It can be caused by a blow on the \\nhead or a fall. There is a brief period of impaired consciousness following the blow to the head.  \\nThe casualty might complain of dizziness, headache, blurred vision or nausea. Typically there is \\na brief loss of memory of any events that occurred at the time of, or immediately preceding, \\nthe injury. \\nF.3.2 CEREBRAL COMPRESSION  \\nSome head injuries may produce a compression of brain tissue.  The pressure inside the skull \\nbuilds up by swelling or bleeding inside the skull.  This condition is life threatening.  \\nCasualties show a deteriorating level of consciousness that may progress to unconsciousness. \\nTherefore, it is important to observe continuously  the conscious level of a casualty that \\nexperienced a head trauma. \\nOther signs and symptoms you may observe are:  \\n\\uf0a7 The person complains of an intense headache. \\n\\uf0a7 The person complains of dizziness. \\n\\uf0a7 The person complains of drowsiness. \\n\\uf0a7 The person complains of blurred or double vision \\n\\uf0a7 The breathing gets noisy and becomes slow. \\n\\uf0a7 A slow but strong pulse (can be felt if the first aider is experienced in the technique \\nof taking the pulse). \\n\\uf0a7 Unequal pupil size. \\n\\uf0a7 Weakness and/or paralysis on one side of the face and/or body. \\n\\uf0a7 A change in the behaviour or the personality of the casualty. \\nF.3.3 SKULL FRACTURES  \\nIf the casualty has a head wound or bruise, be alert for a possible skull fracture also.  A skull \\nfracture is a serious condition because of the underlying risk of brain damage and bleeding.  \\nYou might observe following signs and symptoms: \\n\\uf0a7 There is a soft area or a depression on the scalp.'),\n",

Peristalsis also is at work in this \\norgan, moving food through and mixing it with digestive secretions from the pancreas and \\nliver. The duodenum is largely responsible for the continuous breaking -down process, with \\nthe jejunum and ileum mainly responsible for absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream.  \\nContents of the small intestine start out semi-solid, digested on the way and end in a more \\nliquid form after passing through the organ.

It normally takes about \\n36 hours for stool to get through the colon. The stool itself is mostly food debris and bacteria. \\nThese bacteria perform several useful functions, such as synthesizing various vitamins, \\nprocessing waste products and food particles, and protecting against harmful bacteria. \\nWhen the descending colon becomes full of stool, also c alled faeces, it empties its \\ncontents into the rectum to begin the process of elimination. \\n\\uf0a7 Rectum \\nThe rectum is 18 to 20 cm (app. 8-inch) chamber that connects the colon to the anus.

When anything (gas or \\nstool) comes into the rectum, sensors send a message to the brain. The brain then decides \\nif the rectal contents can be released or not.

This condition is sometimes referred to as ‘ pre-diabetes’. If the \\nblood sugar level is above the normal range, the risk of developing ‘full -blown’ diabetes is \\nincreased.  \\nThere are two main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. \\nG.4.1 TYPE 1 DIABETES \\nIn type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce \\ninsulin. As no insulin is produced, the glucose level increase s, which can seriously damage the \\nbody's organs. People diagnosed with type 1 diabetes need insulin injections for the rest of their \\nlife. \\nType 1 diabetes is often known  as insulin-dependent diabetes . It's also sometimes  known \\nas juvenile diabetes or early-onset diabetes when it develops in young persons , often during \\nthe teenage years.  \\nType 1 diabetes is less common than type 2 diabetes.  \\nG.4.2 TYPE 2 DIABETES \\nType 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn't produce enough insulin, or the body's cells don't \\nrespond to insulin. This is known as insulin resistance. \\nType 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1 diabetes.  \\nPeople diagnosed with type 2 diabetes may be able to control the symptoms simply by eating \\na healthy diet, exercising regularly, and monitoring their blood glucose levels frequently. \\nHowever, as type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes \\nmay eventually need medication, usually in the form of tablets and/or injections. \\nType 2 diabetes is often associated with  obesity. It is sometimes referred to as maturity-onset \\ndiabetes because it's more common in older people. \\nG.4.3 GESTATIONAL DIABETES (DIABETES DURING PREGNANCY) \\nDuring pregnancy, some women have such high levels of blood glucose that their body is \\nunable to  produce enough insulin to convert it into energy . This is known as gestational \\ndiabetes. \\nPregnancy can also make existing type 1 diabetes worse. Ges tational diabetes can increase \\nthe risk of health problems developing in an unborn baby, so it's important to keep the \\nblood glucose levels under control. \\nIn most cases, gestational diabetes develops during the second trimester of pregnancy (weeks \\n14 to 26) and usually disappears after the baby is born. However, women who have gestational \\ndiabetes are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.\"),\n",

Keratinocytes produce the protein known as keratin, the main component of the \\nepidermis. Melanocytes produce the skin pigment, known as melanin. Langerhans cells \\nprevent things from getting into the skin. \\nH.1.2 THE MIDDLE LAYER : DERMIS \\nThe dermis is a complex combination of blood vessels, hair follicles, and sebaceous (oil) glands. \\nHere, you’ll find collagen and elastin, two proteins offering the  skin’s support and elasticity. \\nFibroblasts are the cells that synthesize collagen and elastin.  \\nThis layer also contains pain and touch receptors.  \\nIt is this layer that is responsible for wrinkles. \\nH.1.3 THE FATTY LAYER : HYPODERMIS  \\nThis layer is also known as the subcutis.  \\nIt hosts sweat glands, and fat and collagen cells, and is responsible for conserving your body’s \\nheat and protecting your vital inner organs.'),\n",

A section of the brain called the hypothalamus controls the b ody’s \\nthermoregulation. It issues instructions to muscles, organs, glands, and nervous system when it \\nsenses the core internal temperature is becoming too low or too high.  \\nOne of the major functions of the skin is to help to maintain the body temperature.  \\nH.2.3.1 HOW THE SKIN HELPS TO KEEP THE BODY WARM? \\nWhen the body becomes too cold, blood vessels at the body’s skin surface narrow ( constrict) \\nto keep the warm blood in the core of the body. The activity of the sweat glands in the skin is \\nreduced and the hairs sta nd on end to keep warm air close to the skin. Shivering is a method \\nto generate heat by involuntary muscle activity. \\nH.2.3.2 HOW THE SKIN HELPS TO KEEP THE BODY COLD? \\nWhen the body becomes too hot, blood vessels at the body’s skin surface widen ( dilate) to \\nloose heat by the increased blood flow. The activity of the sweat glands in the skin is turned up \\nto create more sweat, which cools down the skin as it evaporates.  \\nH.2.4 IMMUNITY \\nSeveral types of skin cells (e.g. Langerhans cells, phagocytic cells, epidermal dendritic cells) \\nare responsible for the destruction of microorganisms or are involved in the interaction of the \\nskin with the body's immune system. \\nH.2.5 ALLOWS GROWTH AND MOV EMENT \\nThe elasticity of the skin allows growth, movement and adaptation of the contours of the body \\nduring movement. \\nH.2.6 EXCRETION \\nThe body releases waste products  from the body via the surface of the skin, regulated by the \\nvolume and composition of sweat (e.g. excretion of water, urea, ammonia and uric acid). \\nH.2.7 SYNTHESIS OF VITAMINS  \\nThe skin plays an important role in the synthesis of vitamin D.\"),\n",

However, any burn injury can lead to \\ncomplications. \\nThe danger from burns usually depends more on the area of the burns rather than the degree. \\nSuperficial burns over a large area of the body are more dangerous than the complete \\ncharring of a part of the limb. It must be noted that a burn is mostly a mixture itself of different \\ndegrees of burns, and that in the same person different degrees of burns may show on different \\nparts of the body.  \\nThe most important dangers are: \\n\\uf0a7 Infection \\nBurn injuries leave the skin open and susceptible to infection. Burn injuries also increase \\nyour risk of sepsis, w hich is a life- threatening infection  that rapidly travels through the \\nbloodstream. Sepsis can cause shock and organ failure. \\n\\uf0a7 Low blood volume \\nBurn injuries damage the skin and the blood vessels, causing fluids to escape the body. \\nThis can result in low blood volume, known as hypovolemia. A severe loss of fluid and blood \\ncan prevent the heart from pumping enough blood through the body (resulting in shock). \\n\\uf0a7 Low body temperature \\nThe skin helps to control the body's temperature. When a large portion of the skin is injured, \\nthe body loses heat. This increases the risk of hypothermia — i.e. when the body loses heat \\nfaster than it can produce – resulting in a dangerously low body temperature. \\n\\uf0a7 Breathing difficulties \\nOne of the most common dangers that accompany burn injuries is the inhalation of smoke \\nor hot air. This can burn the airways, making it difficult to breathe. Smoke can permanently \\ndamage the lungs and lead to respiratory failure. \\n\\uf0a7 Pain \\nBurn wounds are very painful.  \\n\\uf0a7 Disability \\nBurn injuries form scar tissue once healed. When the skin is burned,  the surrounding skin \\nstarts to pull together resulting in a post-burn contracture that prevents movement. Deeper \\nburns can limit movement of the bones or joints when skin, muscles or tendons shorten and \\ntighten, permanently pulling joints out of position.\"),\n",

It is caused by the exposure to ultraviolet rays from \\nthe sun. When UV B rays penetrate the deeper skin layers damage to the cells occu rs. The skin \\nbecomes red and painful. In some cases the damage to the cells is so severe resulting in skin \\npeeling and blistering. \\nStrong or cool wind , or a body covered by water or sweat , might give the sunbathing person \\na falsely reassuring effect  of not being sunburned. As c louds have less  limiting effect on UV \\nradiation than they do on temperature, sunburns still can happen on cloudy days . White \\nsurfaces such as snow or sand reflect UV radiation and so increase the risk of sunburn. Rippling \\nwater and rough sea reflect more UV radiation than calm open water.  Sunlight has a shorter \\ndistance to travel in order to reach the earth’s surface in areas closer to the tropics; UV \\nradiation levels will therefore , be higher in these areas because there is less dissi pation of the \\nrays as they travel to earth. The level of UV radiation also increases with altitude as the \\natmosphere becomes thinner and there is less absorption of the radiation.  \\nH.3.9.1.1 WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? \\nFollowing signs and symptoms may be observed when a person suffers a sunburn: \\n\\uf0a7 reddened skin, \\n\\uf0a7 warm skin, and \\n\\uf0a7 pain of varying degrees.  \\nIn more severe cases: \\n\\uf0a7 swelling,  \\n\\uf0a7 blistering, and  \\n\\uf0a7 weeping skin. \\nH.3.9.1.2 WHAT DO I DO? \\n \\n1.

A \\nfrostbite is damage to skin and tissues caused by exposure to freezing temperatures – typically \\nany temperature below minus 0.5 degrees Celsius (31 degrees Fahrenheit).  \\nCauses can be exposure to extreme cold weather , wearing inadequate or wet clothing, or \\nwind chill. The p oor blood circulation caused by too tight clothing or boots, staying in a \\ncramped position, fatigue, certain medications,  smoking, alcohol use, or diseases that affect \\nthe blood vessels, such as diabetes may enhance the process.  \\nFrostbites can affect any part of your body. However, the extremities, such as the hands, feet, \\nears, nose and lips,  are most likely to be affected  as the body is constricting circulation to \\nextremities on its own to preserve core temperature and fight hypothermia. \\nThe symptoms of frostbite usually begin with the affected parts feeling cold and painful. If \\nexposure to  the cold continues, the person may feel pins and needles before the area \\nbecomes numb as the tissues freeze. \\nPeople with a history of severe frostbite often report after effects of frostbite. These can include: \\n\\uf0a7 increased sensitivity to cold; \\n\\uf0a7 numbness in the affected body parts, most commonly the fingers; \\n\\uf0a7 reduced sense of touch in the affected body parts; and \\n\\uf0a7 persistent pain in the affected body parts. \\nH.6.1 WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE ? \\nYou may observe following signs and symptoms: \\n\\uf0a7 The person complains of feeling pins and needles, throbbing or aching in the \\naffected area.  \\n\\uf0a7 The skin feels cold, numb and white. \\n\\uf0a7 The person may feel a tingling sensation. \\nIf the frostbite is more advanced:  \\n\\uf0a7 the affected area may feel hard and frozen; \\n\\uf0a7 when the person is out of the cold: \\n\\uf0a7 the tissue is thawed out (defrosted and becomes soft);  \\n\\uf0a7 the skin will turn red and blister, which can be painful; \\n\\uf0a7 there may also be swelling and itching. \\nIf the exposure to the cold continues and the frostbite develops further:  \\n\\uf0a7 the skin becomes white, blue or blotchy, and \\n\\uf0a7 the tissue underneath feels hard and cold to touch.'),\n",

Fever \\nis generally agreed to be present if the temperature is above 37.7 degrees Celsius (100 \\ndegrees Fahrenheit). \\nFollowing set points are used to identify fever: \\n\\uf0a7 If the temperature in the anus (anal/rectal) is at or over 38.0 degrees Celsius (100.4 \\ndegrees Fahrenheit). \\n\\uf0a7 If the temperature in the mouth (oral) is at or over 37.7 degrees Celsius (100 degrees \\nFahrenheit). \\n\\uf0a7 If the temperature under the arm (axillary) or in the ear (otic) is at or over 37.2 degrees \\nCelsius (99.0 degrees Fahrenheit). \\nH.8.1 HOW TO MEASURE THE BODY TEM PERATURE? \\nThe body’s temperature can be measured by a thermometer you place in the armpit, \\nmouth, rectum, ear or on the forehead.   \\nH.8.1.1 TYPES OF THERMOMETERS \\nH.8.1.1.1  MERCURY TEMPERATURE THERMOME TERS \\n \\nIn a mercury thermometer, a glass tube is filled with mercury and a standard temperature \\nscale is marked on the tube. A mercury thermometer can be easily identified by the \\npresence of a silver bulb. Do not use mercury thermometers to measure the body \\ntemperature via the mouth or rectum. \\nIf the bulb is red, blue, purple, green or any other colour, it is not a mercury thermometer , \\nbut contains another non -poisonous fluid. It works on the same principle as a mercury \\nthermometer. These type of glass thermometer s also can be used to measure the body \\ntemperature via the mouth or rectum. \\nShake down the fluid in the glass thermometer before starting a new temperature \\nmeasurement. Do this by holding the thermometer firmly and flicking the wrist until the fluid \\nreads at or below the lowest number.  \\nWith changes in temperature, the fluid expands and contracts in a consistent fashion and \\nthe temperature can be read from the scale.'),\n",

Such substances are called ‘poisons’ or ‘toxins’. \\nPoisoning can occur when these poisons are taken by accident or with a view to causing \\nharm or committing suicide. \\nPoisons can get into the body by swallowing, inhaling (gases), by injection or via \\nabsorption through the skin. \\nI.1.1 POISONING BY SWALLOWI NG \\nPoisoning from swallowing is often caused by household products, overdose of \\nmedication or toxic plants.  \\nThe effects of poisoning depend on what poison has been swallowed. \\n\\uf0a7 Acids, alkalis, disinfectants etc. swallowed burn the lips, tongue, throat, oesophagus \\nand stomach and cause great pain.  \\n\\uf0a7 Other swallowed poisons cause vomiting, pain abdomen and later on diarrhoea \\n(e.g. poisonous fungi, berries, metallic poisons).  \\n\\uf0a7 Some swallowed poisons affect the nervous system. To this group belong: \\n\\uf0a7 alcoholic drinks (methylated spirit, wine, whisky etc.) when taken in large \\nquantities; \\n\\uf0a7 sleeping pills, tranquilizers, and painkillers  when taken in overdoses. \\nVictims of poisoning must be considered as seriously ill. The symptoms are either delirium or fits \\nor coma. \\nPlease note that ‘Food poisoning’ is an illness caused by eating contaminated food. Please \\nsee the ‘Food poisoning’ chapter page 178 for more information on this topic. \\nI.1.2 POISONING BY GASES  \\nFumes or gases from charcoal stoves, household gas, motor exhausts and smoke from \\nexplosions etc., cause choking (asphyxia) which may result in unconsciousness in addition to \\ndifficulty in breathing.  Please refer to the chapter on ‘Suffocation by smoke or gasses’ for more \\ninformation (page 70). \\nI.1.3 POISONING BY INJECTIO N \\nPoisons get into the body through injection, bites of poisonous snakes and rabid dogs, or stings \\nby scorpions and poisonous insects. Danger to life is again by choking and coma. Pl ease refer \\nto the chapter on animal bites for more information (page 240). \\nI.1.4 POISONING BY SKIN ABS ORPTION \\nHazardous chemicals that are spilt on the skin can cause irritation or burns. Certain substances \\ncan be also absorbed through the skin and cause damage inside the body. Please refer to the \\nchapter on ‘Chemical burns’ for more information (page 206).'),\n",

After the body has taken the \\nfood components that it needs, waste products are left behind in the bowel and in the blood. \\nThe kidney and urinary systems help the body to eliminate liquid waste called urea, and to \\nkeep chemicals, such as potassium and sodium, and water in balance. Urea is produced when \\nfoods containing protein, such as meat, poultry, and certain vegetables, are broken down in \\nthe body. Urea is carried in the bloodstream to the kidneys, where it is removed along with \\nwater and other wastes in the form of urine. \\nOther important functions of the kidneys include blood pressure regulation and the production \\nof erythropoietin, which controls red blood cell production in the bone marrow. Kidneys also \\nregulate the acid-base balance and conserve fluids. \\n \\nA pair of purplish-brown organs, the kidneys, are located below the ribs toward the middle of \\nthe back. The functions of the kidneys are to: \\n\\uf0a7 Remove waste products and drugs from the body. \\n\\uf0a7 Balance the body's fluids. \\n\\uf0a7 Release hormones to regulate blood pressure. \\n\\uf0a7 Control production of red blood cells. \\nThe kidneys remove urea from the blood through tiny filtering units called nephrons. Each \\nnephron consists of a ball formed of small blood capillaries, called a glomerulus, and a small \\ntube called a renal tubule.

About \\nevery 10 to 15 seconds, small amounts of urine are emptied into the bladder from the ureters.  \\nThe bladder, a  triangle-shaped, hollow organ , is located in the lower abdomen.

The penis is made up of two parts, the \\nshaft and the glans. The glans is the tip of the penis, while the shaft is the main part of the penis \\nand contains the tube (urethra) that drains the bladder. All boys are born with a foreskin, or a \\ncovering over the tip of the penis. Some boys are circumcised, which means that this covering \\nof skin is removed. Other boys are not circumcised and may have skin that covers the ti p of \\nthe penis. \\nThe scrotum is a bag of skin which holds and helps to protect the testicles. The testicles (or \\ntestes) are the male sex glands and are part of the male reproductive system. They are located \\nin the scrotum. To make sperm the temperature of t he testicles needs to be cooler than the \\ninside of the body. This is why they are located in the scrotum outside body. The testes are also \\ninvolved in producing a hormone called testosterone. Testosterone is an important hormone \\nduring male development and maturation for developing muscles, deepening the voice, and \\ngrowing body hair.  \\nA long tube, the epididymis, is located near each testicle. The epididymis is a collection of \\nmicroscopic tubes in which the sperms are stored. The vas deferens is the tube wh ich moves \\nthe sperms from the testicles out of the scrotal sac to the urethra and connects these together. \\nSeminal vesicles, the sac-like glands, lie behind the bladder and release a fluid that forms part \\nof semen. \\nThe prostate gland is about the size of a  walnut, and surrounds the neck of the bladder and \\nurethra. The prostate gland secretes a slightly alkaline fluid that forms part of the seminal fluid, \\na fluid that carries sperms. During male climax (orgasm), the muscular glands of the prostate \\nhelp to propel the prostate fluid, in addition to sperms that were made in the testicles, into the \\nurethra. \\nThe urethra is the tube that allows urine to flow outside the body. It is also the channel for semen \\nto pass during ejaculation.'),\n",

This is \\nwhere a man’s penis enters the woman during sexual intercourse. The vaginal opening is visible \\nfrom the outside but it is protected by the labia  \\nThe labia majora are two folds of skin that extend from the front of the vaginal opening to the \\nback of it. The outer surfaces of the folds have darker -colored skin and thick hairs, while the \\ninner folds are smoother.  The labia majora join to form the cleft shape of the female genitals.  \\nThe clitoris is a crucial element for sexual arousal in most women. This small sexual organ at the \\njunction of the labia minora appears outside the folds of skin like a small pink button. During \\nsexual stimulation, the clitoris functions much like a man’s penis in that it becomes erect due to \\nthe signals from the brain. The clitoris is a very sensitive area when stimulated.  \\nBetween the labia majora are the labia minora, two folds of skin that also extend down from \\nthe clitoris and around the vaginal opening. These vary in size from woman to woman. They \\nare joined together by a small fold of skin known as the fourchette. \\nThe outer female genitals also include the urethra. Located between the vaginal opening and \\nthe frontal connection of the labia minora, the urethral opening is where a woman expels urine \\nfrom her body. \\nThe womb or uterus is located between the bladder and the rectum, in the pelvic area. The \\nuterus is connected to the fallopian tubes, the cervix, and (via the cervix) the vagina.   \\nIn menstruating females, the ovaries release eggs that travel via the fall opian tubes to the \\nuterus. If fertilized, the egg will bind to the wall of the uterus and the foetus will develop. The \\nuterus nourishes and protects the foetus until birth. \\nThe cervix of the uterus, also known as the cervix or uterine cervix, attaches the vagina to the \\nuterus. It is approximately four centimetres long. The uterine cervix produces a mucus that aids \\nin carrying sperm from the vagina to the uterus, where it can fertilize an egg if the woman is \\novulating. When the woman isn't ovulating, the cervical mucus thickens and serves as a barrier \\nto keep sperm out of the uterus. \\nDuring childbirth, the cervix thins out and eventually dilates (expands) to 10 centimetres to \\nallow the baby to pass through the birth canal. Once the baby is born and the placen ta is \\nexpelled, the cervix begins to thicken and close.\"),\n",

Usually the most obvious sign is the \\nabsence of menstruation (amenorrhea). However, some women may continue to have some \\nbleeding even while pregnant. The following  are the most common initial signs of pregnancy. \\nHowever, each woman may experience the signs of pregnancy differently. These may include: \\n\\uf0a7 fatigue, \\n\\uf0a7 sore and swollen breasts, \\n\\uf0a7 nausea or vomiting (also called morning sickness), \\n\\uf0a7 frequent urination, \\n\\uf0a7 certain food cravings or aversions, \\n\\uf0a7 bloating of the abdomen, and \\n\\uf0a7 darkening of the skin around the breast nipples (also called the areola). \\nThese early signs may not always indicate pregnancy, but may signal another process \\noccurring within the body \\nA pregnancy is divided into three phases, called trimesters. Each trimester has its own significant \\nmilestones. The first trimester is the most fragile period, during which all major organs and \\nsystems are formed. Most birth defects and miscarriages occur during the first trimester. During \\nthe second and third trimesters, the foetus is fully formed and grows and matures rapidly. \\nAfter nine months of incredible growth and changes both in the mother and the foetus, labour \\n(contractions) may finally start, signalling the pendin g birth of the baby. Some  women may \\nfear the prospect of delivering their child. Part of this fear may be attributed to the unknown, \\nespecially in first pregnancy. \\nLabour is a series of continuous, progressive contractions of the uterus which help the cervix to \\nopen (dilate) and to thin (efface), allowing the foetus to move through the birth canal.  Signs \\nof labour vary from woman to woman, as each woman experiences labour differently.  \\nSome common signs of labour may include: \\n\\uf0a7 A small amount of mucus, sligh tly mixed with blood, may be expelled from the \\nvagina indicating a woman is in labour.  \\n \\n\\uf0a7 Contractions (uterine muscle spasms) occurring at intervals of less than ten minutes \\nare usually an indication that labour has begun. Contractions may become more \\nfrequent and severe as labour progresses.  \\n \\n\\uf0a7 Labour sometimes begins with amniotic fluid gushing or leaking from the vagina. \\nWomen who experience a rupture of the amniotic sac should go to the healthcare \\nfacility immediately. The majority of women go into labour within hours after the \\namniotic sac breaks. If labour still does not begin, it needs to be induced.'),\n",

The first stage, when the contractions make the cervix gradually open up (dilate). \\nThis is usually the longest stage. \\n2. The second stage of labour is when the cervix is fully open and birth is given. This is \\nthe part of labour where the baby moves through the vagina by the woman in \\nlabour pushing with the contractions. \\n3. The third stage of labour is after the birth, when the womb contracts and causes \\nthe placenta to come out through the vagina. \\nL.3.1.1 THE FIRST STAGE OF LABOUR – DILATION \\nThe cervix needs to open about ten cm for a baby to pass through. This is what\\'s called being \\n\"fully dilated\". Contractions at the start of labour help to soften the cervix so that it gradually \\nopens. \\nThe woman in labour should attempt to get comfortable and relaxed, and if possible try to \\nsleep. A warm bath or shower may help to relax.  \\nDuring the day, the woman in labour can keep upright and be gently active. This helps the \\nbaby move down into the pelvis and helps the cervix to dilate. \\nOnce labour is established, the cervix reaches an opening of more than three centimetres; the \\ntime to full dilation is usually between 6 and 12 hours. It is often quicker in subsequent \\npregnancies. The woman in labour wi ll be asked not to try to push until the cervix is fully open \\nand the baby’s head can be seen. To help to overcome the urge to push, breathing out slowly \\nand gently or, if the urge is too strong breathing in small puffs may help. Some women find this \\neasier lying on their side, or on their knees and elbows, to reduce the pressure of the baby’s \\nhead on the cervix. \\nL.3.1.2 THE SECOND STAGE OF LABOUR \\nThis is the \"pushing\" stage. It begins when the cervix is fully dilated and lasts until the birth of the \\nbaby.  When the cervix is fully dilated the woman in labour will be asked to push when she feels \\nthe need to do so during contractions.  \\nThis stage of labour is hard work. This stage may take 1-2 hour. \\nWHAT HAPPENS AT THE ACTUAL BIRTH? \\nDuring the second stage, the baby’s head moves down the vagina until it can be seen. When \\nthe head is almost ready to come out, the woman in labour will be asked to stop pushing and \\nto do a couple of quick short breaths, blowing out through the mouth. This  is done so that the \\nbaby’s head can be born slowly and gently, giving the skin and muscles of the perineum (the \\narea between the vagina and anus) time to stretch without tearing. The skin of the perineum \\nusually stretches well, but it may tear. Afterwards , the cut or tear may be stitched up to help \\nthe healing process.  \\nOnce baby’s head is born, most of the hard work is over. With one more gentle push, the body \\nis born quite quickly and easily. The baby may be born covered with a white, greasy substance \\nknown as vernix, which has acted as protection in the uterus.'),\n",

However, with proper medical \\ncare, most women can enjoy a healthy pregnancy, despite their medical challenges.  It is \\nimportant that the pregnant woman contacts her healthcare provider early.  \\nL.5.1 DIABETES \\nDiabetes in pregnancy can have serious consequences for the mother and the growing foetus. \\nThe severit y of problems often depends on the severity of the mother's diabetic disease, \\nespecially if she has vascular (blood vessel) complications and poor blood glucose control.   \\nGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the condition in which the glucose level is elevated and \\nother diabetic symptoms appear during pregnancy in a woman who has not previously been \\ndiagnosed with diabetes. In most cases of GDM, all diabetic symptoms disappear following \\ndelivery. However, women with gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing \\ndiabetes later in life, especially if they were overweight before pregnancy. Unlike other types \\nof diabetes, gestational diabetes is not caused by a lack of insulin, but by other hormones that \\nblock the insulin that is produced, a condition referred to as insulin resistance. \\nL.5.2 HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE  \\nHigh blood pressure can occur in pregnancy in two forms. It may be a pre -existing condition, \\ncalled chronic hypertension , or it can develop during pregnancy -- a condition known as \\ngestational hypertension. It is also called toxemia or preeclampsia/eclampsia and occurs most \\noften in young women with the first pregnancy. It is more common in twin pregnancies, and in \\nwomen who had blood pressure problems in a previous pregnancy.  \\nHigh blood pressure ca n lead to placental complications and slowed foetal growth. If \\nuntreated, severe hypertension may cause dangerous seizures and even death in the mother \\nand foetus.  \\nWomen who have high blood pressure before pregnancy often need to continue taking their \\nantihypertensive medication. Such patients need to be managed by joint physician and \\ngynaecologist care before conception and during pregnancy. Only the treating physician and \\nthe gynaecologist can give the correct advice on this. \\nL.5.3 INFECTIONS \\nInfections during  pregnancy can pose a threat to the foetus. Even a simple urinary tract \\ninfection or vaginal infection  which is common during pregnancy, should be treated \\nimmediately. An infection that goes untreated can lead to preterm labour and rupture of the \\nmembranes surrounding the foetus. \\nL.5.3.1 FOOD POISONING (E.G. LISTERIOSIS)  \\nA pregnant woman should avoid eating undercooked or raw foods because of the risk of food \\npoisoning. Food poisoning can dehydrate a mother and deprive the foetus of nourishment.  \\nL.5.3.2  CHLAMYDIA \\nChlamydia is a common sexually transmitted disease  (STD) that can infect both men and \\nwomen. It can cause serious, permanent damage to a woman's reproductive system, making \\nit difficult or impossible for her to get pregnant later on. Chlamydia infection is associated with \\ntubal disease and tubal pregnancy (pregnancy that occurs outside the womb) which can be \\nfatal.\"),\n",

Genital \\nherpes can be spread to the baby during delivery, if a woman has an active infection at that \\ntime.  \\nHerpes infections can cause blisters and ulcers on the mouth or f ace (oral herpes), or in the \\ngenital area (genital herpes). HSV is a life-long infection. Symptoms of HSV may include painful \\nblisters or open sores in the genital area, which may be preceded by a tingling or burning \\nsensation in the legs, buttocks, or gen ital region. The herpes sores usually disappear within a \\nfew weeks, but the virus remains in the body and the lesions may recur from time to time.  \\nIt is important that women avoid contracting herpes during pregnancy, because a first episode \\nduring pregnancy creates a greater risk of transmission to the new -born. Genital herpes can \\ncause potentially fatal infections in babies if the mother has active genital herpes (shedding \\nthe virus) at the time of delivery. Fortunately, infection of an infant is rare amo ng women with \\ngenital herpes infection. Protection from genital herpes includes abstaining from sex when \\nsymptoms are present, and /or using latex condoms the right way every time having sex.  \\nL.5.3.6 CMV (CYTOMEGALOVIRUS) \\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) is one of the herpes  viruses.  CMV is spread by close contact with a \\nperson who has the virus in his or her saliva, urine, or other body fluids.  \\nCMV can be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her foetus during pregnancy. The virus in \\nthe mother’s blood crosses over the plac enta and infects the foetus’ blood. Most babies with \\ncongenital (meaning present at birth) CMV infection never have health problems. But in some \\nbabies, congenital CMV infection causes health problems that may be apparent at birth or \\nmay develop later during infancy or childhood. \\nA few simple steps can help to avoid exposure to saliva and urine that might contain CMV: \\n\\uf0a7 Washing the hands often with soap and water for 40-60 seconds, especially after \\n\\uf0a7 changing diapers, \\n\\uf0a7 feeding a young child, \\n\\uf0a7 wiping a young child’s nose or drool, or \\n\\uf0a7 handling children’s toys. \\n\\uf0a7 Do not share food, drinks, or eating utensils used by young children. \\n\\uf0a7 Avoid contact with saliva when kissing a child. \\n\\uf0a7 Clean toys, countertops, and other surfaces that come into contact with children’s \\nurine or saliva.'),\n",

The bump is painful, soft and usually bursts and forms an ulcer within a \\nday of its appearance. Along with this bump (or ulcer), small rubbery bumps (but different from \\nthe former) may also be felt in the crease between the belly and thigh.  \\nPeople infected with this bacteria spread it to others through sexual contact.  \\nL.6.1.2 CHLAMYDIA \\nChlamydia is common and is easily passed on du ring sex. Most people don't experience any \\nsymptoms, so they are unaware they're infected. \\nIn women, chlamydia can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a vaginal \\ndischarge, pain in the lower abdomen during or after sex, and bleeding during or after sex or \\nbetween periods. It can also cause heavy periods. \\nIn men, chlamydia can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a white, cloudy or \\nwatery discharge from the tip of the penis, and pain or tenderness in the testicles.  \\nIt's also possible to have a chlamydia infection in the rectum (bottom), throat or eyes.  \\nYou can get chlamydia through unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex or by contact with \\npartner’s genitals, or sharing sex toys when they are not washed or covered with a new \\ncondom between each person who uses them. Sexual fluid from the penis or vagina can pass \\nchlamydia from one person to another even if the penis does not enter the vagina, anus or \\nmouth. This means you can get chlamydia from genital contact with someone who has the \\ninfection even if there is no penetration, orgasm or ejaculation. It isn’t clear if chlamydia could \\nbe passed on by transferring infected semen or vaginal fluid on the fingers, or by rubbing \\nfemale genitals together. Chlamydia cannot be passed on through ca sual contact, including \\nkissing and hugging, or from sharing baths, towels, swimming pools, toilet seats or cutlery.  \\nL.6.1.3 DONOVANOSIS \\nDonovanosis is a sexually transmissible genital ulcer disease. The bac terium that causes it is \\nKlebsiella granulomatis. It infects the skin around the genitals, groin or anal area and causes \\nulcers and destruction of the skin.  After infection, one or more initially painless ulcers (sores) or \\nlumps develop on the genitals, or around the anus or mouth.  \\nWithout treatment the ulcers will increase in size and can form a raised red fleshy lump that \\nprogressively destroys normal skin. Other bacteria can infect these sores, causing them to \\nbecome painful and distressing with an unpleasant smell. \\nDonovanosis is spread by sexual contact. Sy mptoms generally appear from 1 -4 weeks after \\ninfection but occasionally may take as long as a year to develop. A very small proportion of \\npeople may be infected through direct, nonsexual contact (skin-to-skin contact).\"),\n",

They're caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). The warts are usually \\npainless, but they may give some itching or redness. Occasionally, they can cause bleeding. \\nGenital warts can be spread during vaginal or anal sex, and by sharing sex toys. A person does \\nnot need to have penetrative sex to pass the infection on because HPV is spread by skin -to-\\nskin contact. \\nL.6.1.5 GENITAL HERPES \\nGenital herpes is a common infection caused by the herpes simplex virus  (HSV), which is the \\nsame virus that causes cold sores. \\nSome people develop symptoms of HSV a few days after coming into contact with the virus. \\nSmall, painful blisters or sores usually develop, wh ich may cause itching or tingling, or make it \\npainful to urinate. After a person is infected, the virus remains dormant (inactive) most of the \\ntime. However, certain triggers can reactivate the virus, causing the blisters to develop again, \\nalthough they're usually smaller and less painful. \\nGenital herpes is usually transmitted by having sex (vaginal, anal or oral) with an infected \\nperson. Even if someone with genital herpes doesn't have any symptoms, it's possible for them \\nto pass the infection to a sexual partner. \\nL.6.1.6 GONORRHOEA \\nGonorrhoea is a STI easily passed on during sex  caused by bacteria called Neisseria \\ngonorrhoeae or gonococcus. About 50% of women and 10% of men don't experience any \\nsymptoms and are unaware that they are infected. \\nIn women , gonorrhoea can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a vaginal \\ndischarge (often watery, yellow or green), pain in the lower abdomen during or after sex, and \\nbleeding during or after sex or between periods, sometimes causing heavy periods.  \\nIn men, gonorrhoea can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a white, yellow or \\ngreen discharge from the tip of the penis, and pain or tenderness in the testicles.  \\nIt's also possible to have a gonorrhoea infection in the rectum, throat or eyes.  \\nGonorrhoea is easily passed between people through unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex or \\nby sharing sex toys that haven't been washed or covered with a new condom each time they \\nare used. Gonorrhoea is not spread by kissing, hugging, sharing baths or towe ls, swimming \\npools, toilet seats, or sharing cups, plates and cutlery, because the bacteria can't survive \\noutside the human body for long. \\nL.6.1.7 HEPATITIS B  \\nHepatitis B is a type of virus that can infect the liver.  \\nSymptoms can include feeling sick, lack of ap petite, flu -like symptoms, such as tiredness, \\ngeneral aches and pains, and headaches, and yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice). \\nHowever, many people don't realise they have been infected with the virus because the \\nsymptoms may not develop immediately, or even at all.

There\\'s no cure for HIV, but there are treatments that allow most people to live a \\nlong and otherwise healthy life. \\nAIDS is the final stage of an HIV infection, when your body can no longer fight life -threatening \\ninfections. \\nMost people with HIV look and feel healthy and have no symptoms. When you first develop \\nHIV, you may experience a flu -like illness with a feve r, sore throat or rash. This is called a \\nseroconversion illness.  \\nHIV is most commonly passed on through unprotected sex. It can also be transmitted by \\ncoming into contact with infected blood – for example, and sharing needles and syringes. \\nL.6.1.9 PUBIC LICE \\nPubic lice (\"crabs\" ( because they look similar to crabs. )) are easily passed to others through \\nclose genital contact. They\\'re usually found in pubic hair, but can live in underarm hair, body \\nhair, beards and occasionally eyebrows or eyelashes. \\nIt may take seve ral weeks for you to notice any symptoms. Most people experience itching, \\nand you may notice the lice or eggs on the hairs. Pubic lice are sometimes called crab lice \\nbecause they look similar to crabs. \\nPubic lice spread through close body contact with someone who has them. The lice crawl from \\nhair to hair, but cannot fly or jump. They need human blood to survive, so generally leave the \\nbody to move from one person to another. They are most commonly passed on during sexual \\ncontact. Condoms will not prevent them being passed to another person. It is also possible for \\npubic lice to be spread through sharing clothes, towels and bedding. \\nL.6.1.10 SCABIES \\nScabies is caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin. It can be passed on through close \\nbody or sexual contact, or from infected clothing, bedding or towels. \\nIf a person develops scabies, he may experience an intense itching that\\'s worse at night. The \\nitching can be in the genital area, but it also often occurs between the fingers, on wrists and \\nankles, under the arms, or on the body and breasts. \\nThe infected person may have a rash or tiny spots. In some people, scabies can be confused \\nwith eczema. It\\'s usually very difficult to see the mites. \\nScabies mites can be passed on through close body or sexual contact, or from infected \\nclothing, bedding or towels. \\nL.6.1.11 SYPHILIS \\nSyphilis is a bacterial infection (Treponema pallidum) that in the early stages causes a painless, \\nbut highly infectious, sore on the genitals or around the mouth.

Pregnant women can pass the infection to their unborn baby. Syphilis also cannot be \\nspread by using the same toilet, clothing, cutl ery or bathroom as an infected person, as the \\nbacteria cannot survive for long outside the human body. \\nL.6.1.12 TRICHOMONIASIS \\nTrichomoniasis is an STI caused by a tiny parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis (TV). It can be \\neasily passed on through sex and most people don't know that they're infected. \\nIn women, trichomoniasis can cause a frothy yellow or watery vaginal discharge that has an \\nunpleasant smell, soreness or itching around the vagina, and pain when passing urine.  \\nIn men, trichomoniasis rarely causes sympt oms. You may experience pain or burning after \\npassing urine, a whitish discharge, or an inflamed foreskin. \\nThe parasite is usually spread by having unprotected sex (without using a condom), although \\nit can also be spread by sharing sex toys.

They might feel overwhelmed, worried, \\nconfused or feel uncertainness. Some people might show little or no signs, others might present \\nwith a more severe reaction.   \\nThe SPHERE (2011) and IASC (2007) define psychological first aid (PFA) as a humane, supportive \\nresponse to a fellow human being who is suffering and who may need support.  It includes: \\n\\uf0a7 providing practical care and support, which does not intrude; \\n\\uf0a7 assessing needs and concerns; \\n\\uf0a7 helping people to address basic needs (for example, food and water, information); \\n\\uf0a7 listening to people, but not pressuring them to talk; \\n\\uf0a7 comforting people and helping them to feel calm; \\n\\uf0a7 helping people connect to information, services and social supports, and \\n\\uf0a7 protecting people from further harm. \\nPhysical and psychological first aid go hand in hand and should be delivered simultaneously.'),\n",

One may say that the traumatic \\ncrisis can be divided into four phases: \\n1. (Psychological) Shock phase. \\n2. Reaction phase. \\n3. Processing phase. \\n4. Reorientation phase. \\nM.2.1 (PSYCHOLOGICAL ) SHOCK PHASE  \\nThe shock phase follows immediately after the event which triggered the crisis. During the shock \\nphase, the person is not yet able to comprehend the event that caused the crisis and may \\neven deny it. While some people in shock become completely paralysed, others behave in a \\nmechanical and cold way. Some people in shock may become strongly agitated; they may \\nscream or cry furiously. People may also alternate between paralysis and restlessness  states. \\nThe reactions of people in shock, such as apparent lack of feelings, may confuse the people \\nclose to them and even cause embarrassment or resentment.  \\nThe shock phase may include:  \\n\\uf0a7 denial,'),\n",

The person will slowly face the tragic incident and try to \\nunderstand what has happened. At the beginning of the reaction  phase, people might \\nexperience strange and unexpected sensations; for example, they may feel that the person \\nthey have lost is still around or they may hear their voice somewhere.  \\nThe feelings of people in the reaction phase are often very similar to eac h other and they are \\noften expressed in the same form: \"I think I’m going crazy\", \"I can’t take it any more\", \"will I ever \\nmake it through?\", \"life feels like a rollercoaster\", or \"will this pain last forever?\", for example.  \\nThe reaction phase may include: \\n\\uf0a7 fear and anxiety, \\n\\uf0a7 self-accusations and the need to find someone to blame, \\n\\uf0a7 sleeplessness and loss of appetite, and \\n\\uf0a7 nausea or other physical symptoms. \\nDuring the reaction phase of a crisis, people often feel the need to be heard. They may feel \\nthe need to discuss the matter over and over again. This may feel very heavy and consuming \\nto the people close to the individual.  \\nM.2.3 PROCESSING PHASE  \\nIn the processing phase, the person begins to understand what has happened. The matter is \\nno longer denied; instead, the  person understands that the incident and all its changes and \\nlosses are really true. The person is ready to face all the different aspects of the incident and \\nthe new personal situation.  He is aware of the changes caused by the crisis and often begins \\nto analyse his own identity and personal convictions and beliefs. He begins to think beyond the \\nevent, but will not yet have strength to plan for the future. Nevertheless, the person is preparing \\nto face the future.  He also regains the capability to better concentrate on everyday life. \\nThe processing phase may include: \\n\\uf0a7 problems with memory and concentration, \\n\\uf0a7 irritability, and \\n\\uf0a7 withdrawal from social relationships. \\nM.2.4 REORIENTATION PHASE  \\nThe crisis is over. The person is able to live with what has happened, and it is no longer constantly \\non his mind. Every once in a while, the pain will resurface but there is also joy in life; the person \\nwill be able to look to the future and regain confidence in life. \\nNevertheless, the course of a crisis is not always straightfo rward; for example, things reminding \\nof the incident can bring back heavy thoughts, anxiety and other symptoms.'),\n",

It is important to start with limiting the physical inju ries. You \\nmust first and foremost give life-saving first aid where necessary, in order to make sure that the \\ninjured persons get to the hospital alive. Doing the best you can to limit the injuries as much as \\npossible also has a very soothing effect on the injured ones, and on all others present: ‘There is \\nsomeone who helps’. \\nM.3.1 BEHAVE CALMLY  \\nBehaving calmly has a very soothing effect on the casualties and the psychically affected \\npersons. Calmness can be just as contagious as uneasiness. \\nBehaving calmly is: \\n\\uf0a7 Speaking quietly in a normal pitch. \\n\\uf0a7 Focus the right amount of time on the person you are there to help, instead of \\nrunning from one thing to the other. \\n\\uf0a7 Showing clearly that you have time to take care of the affected person. \\n\\uf0a7 Avoiding mentioning that it seems to take too long for the ambulance or other \\nhelping teams to arrive. \\nM.3.2 LISTEN TO THE AFFECTE D PERSON \\nThe affected person must be given the opportunity to tell what he has experienced. This is \\ncalled “Venting”. \\nYou must accept what he tells you, and you must not comment on it; only ask questions which \\nmake him enlarge upon the subject.  \\nPerhaps his account sounds quite unbelievable, but to him that is what he has experienced or \\nthinks he has experienced. By telling about the experiences he gets a chance to recognize for \\nhimself that quite incredible things, which he thinks he has experienced and which make him \\nfrightened, are not true. This way he can get free of these fantasies.  \\nVenting experiences also has the result that he gets them sorted ou t and gets them placed in \\nthe proper succession in his memory. It makes it easier to endure having experiences emerging \\nas a tangled series of frightening pictures which he cannot control at all.  \\nYou should: \\n\\uf0a7 Try to find a quiet place to talk, and minimize outside distractions. \\n\\uf0a7 Respect privacy and keep the person’s story confidential, if this is appropriate.'),\n",

Be honest about what you \\nknow and don’t know. Say “I don’t know, but I will try to find out about that for you.” \\nif you can’t answer the question.  \\n\\uf0a7 Give information in a way the person can understand and keep it. \\n\\uf0a7 Acknowledge how he is feeling. \\n\\uf0a7 If he tells you about any losses or important events, such as loss of the home or \\ndeath of a loved one, reply with “I’m so sorry. I can imagine this is very sad for you.” \\n\\uf0a7 Acknowledge the person’s strengths and how he has helped himself. \\n\\uf0a7 Allow for silence. \\n\\uf0a7 Make it clear to people that even if they refuse help now, they can still access help \\nin the future. \\nM.3.3 GENERAL CONSIDERATION  WHEN GIVING HELP  \\nConsider following basic topics when providing help or when you ask bystanders to give help:  \\n\\uf0a7 Get his personal belongings gathered. \\n\\uf0a7 Find out where he is going. \\n\\uf0a7 Find out how he got there. \\n\\uf0a7 Make sure that there is someone who can take care of the affected one when he \\narrives at the destination. \\nM.3.4 PHYSICAL CONTACT \\nIt helps incredibly and creates an immediate sense of security, if y ou take the hand of the \\naffected person or put an arm around his shoulder while you listen to him. If he cries - which in \\nitself is very good for him - you can allow him to put his head on your shoulder. \\nPhysical contact is so important because the affecte d person unconsciously will try to protect \\nhimself from the violent psychic trauma by reacting like a child. For this reason contact with a \\n\"grown-up\" helper may help him to feel more secure.'),\n",

It is necessary that we set \\naside our culture constraints; when you are giving psychological first aid the affected person \\nshould be allowed to give way to his feelings. Tell him you understand this.  \\nM.3.6 PROTECT AGAINST INQUI SITIVE ONLOOKERS  \\nThe affected person will be embarrassed showing his feelings, and he will, altogether, feel sorry \\nto let other people see him in this particular situation. \\nA person may react on the onlookers in different ways. He may try to hide himself in an \"ostrich \\nlike\" manner by holding his hands in front of his face, but he may just as well react very \\naggressively and abuse them. \\nYour help must consist in getting the affected one away from the onlookers, or make them \\nleave the area. \\nM.3.7 DO NOT LET THE AFFECT ED PERSON BE ALONE  \\nEven if the affected person does not like to have people around him, it is not a good idea to \\nleave him alone with his psychic crisis. His feelings will seem much more oppressive when he is \\nalone with them. \\nYou have to make sure that someone else can stay with him, if you cannot continue to provide \\nhelp. It is important that the person who stays with him knows what has happened, and what \\nthe situation is. It will also be of great advantage, if the helper who takes over, knows the basics \\nof psychological first aid and provides the best humane support. \\nM.3.8 PROVIDING PSYCHOLOGIC AL FIRST AID TO ALL  \\nThis means giving immediate emotional support to those who are physically injured, as well as \\nto those who are not physically injured but might be psychologically impacted.  \\nAlso, look after the confused, the lost, and those who are separated from families. Care for \\nthose who are left behind. Help them to be re-united with their relatives.  \\nRecovering from a psychological injur y can take longer than recovering from a wound. The \\nperson may need your continuing support in the weeks ahead \\nWhen there are mass casualties follow the instructions of the medical team in charge.  \\nM.3.9 DON’T FORGET TO TAKE CAR E OF YOURSELF  \\nHelping responsibly also means taking care of your own health and wellbeing.  \\nAs a helper, you may be affected by what you experience in a crisis situation, or you or your \\nfamily may be directly affected by the event. It is important to pay extra attention to your own \\nwellbeing and be sure that you are physically and emotionally able to help others. Take care \\nof yourself so that you can care best for others.  \\nIf working in a team, be aware of the wellbeing of your fellow helpers as well.'),\n",

Usually these are only minor bruises \\nand grazes, but sometimes the child may incur a severe accident resulting in fracture, \\nbleeding, suffocation, fainting, burns, drowning or electric shock (etc.).   \\nAlso, a school staff member may suffer a heart attack or a respiratory disorder with which first \\naiders have to cope.  \\nUnder these circumstances the first aider should be able to rise to the occasion, instead of \\ngetting nervous. There are several simple procedures anyone can learn and, if correctly and \\nimmediately applied, can make the difference between life and death.  \\nChildren are liable to the same type of emergencies and injuries as adults in similar \\ncircumstances. Details on how to handle emergency c ases are described in the various \\nchapters of this training programme. The procedure of attending an emergency always \\nremains the same and includes the following: \\n1. Assess the situation. \\n2. Safety first. \\n3. Alert and seek help. \\n4. Provide first-aid. \\n5. Transport or refer to a healthcare facility, if needed. \\n6. Hygiene. \\nTraining and exercising helps the first aider to act swiftly, calmly and in the correct way. There \\nis no substitute for proper training! \\nThe school management should ensure that: \\n\\uf0a7 a well-equipped first aid room or station with the necessary materials is available, \\n\\uf0a7 a trained first aider(s) is(are) available in the school or is on call, and \\n\\uf0a7 in each class at least one child (preferably more) is trained in first aid. \\nHaving trained first aiders available is a great asset to the school at the time of emergency.  \\nIt is again underlined that there is no substitute for proper training. The Red Cross and St John \\nAmbulance organize first aid trainings for teachers, staff and students. Make sure each school \\nhas a SOP (Standard Operating Procedures) for any disaster including violence by fellow \\nstudents and others.'),\n",

This can result in twisted lim bs, lacerations, severe bleeding and fractures, and \\nmay lead to shock.   \\nIn some cases it is not possible to extricate or release the victim easily. In all cases, the \\nmachinery should be stopped immediately, the power of the machine cut off and a person \\nwho is familiar with handling the machine or a senior foreman should be called to the scene.  \\nMost modern machines have automatic releasing devices. Eventually, machine parts may \\nhave to be dismantled to get access and release the casualty.  \\nThe first aider must assess the situation, ensure the safety for himself and casualty, control any \\nbleeding, provide the necessary first aid, prevent shock and reassure the casualty. He \\ncontinuously needs to observe the casualty’s condition. It is best to cover any injured or burned \\nparts when possible. Provide CPR when needed, and arrange for immediate medical aid on \\nsite or transport to a healthcare facility or hospital. \\nDetails on how to handle this and other emergency cases are described in the various chapters \\nof this  training programme. The procedure of attending an emergency always remains the \\nsame and includes the following: \\n1. Assess the situation. \\n2. Safety first. \\n3. Alert and seek help. \\n4.

They may also feel that they will have to bear the expenditure of the \\ntransportation.  \\nThis thinking is not correct. A person who is lying he lpless can be relieved from sufferings if \\nsomeone provides the appropriate first aid and transport him to the nearest medical facility. \\nEven a little knowledge of first aid of trained laypeople can save lives.  \\nTo overcome this difficulty and to create publ ic awareness of the moral duty to help, the \\ngovernment, the court and the police have been issuing instructions via the press, posters and \\nradio- and TV-spots that members of public are to be given a positive response in their noble \\ntask helping and transporting the injured at the earliest to the healthcare facility or hospital for \\nfurther medical aid. Instructions have also been given to police staff to ensure that such persons \\nwho bring an injured to the hospital for medical aid are not be detained. It sh ould suffice for \\nthe emergency centres in hospitals to ask only following questions to the person who brings the \\ninjured to the hospital:  \\n1. Where have you brought this casualty from? \\n2. Do you know anything about the cause of the injury of the casualty? \\n3. May I have your particulars? \\nIt is likely that the person would answer the first question, but may not be able to answer the \\nsecond one. He might hesitate to answer to the third question, in which case it should not be \\ninsisted upon. The escorts should, under no  circumstances be detained in the hospital for \\ninterrogation. On the other hand he should be treated with courtesy. \\nHowever, rendering aid to the injured is the moral and civil duty of each and every one of us.  \\nDetails on how to handle these emergency cases are described in the various chapters of this \\ntraining programme. The procedure of attending an emergency always remains the same and \\nincludes the following: \\n1. Assess the situation. \\n2. Safety first. \\n3. Alert and seek help. \\n4. Provide first-aid. \\n5. Transport or refer to a healthcare facility, if needed. \\n6. Hygiene. \\nTraining and exercising helps the first aider to act swiftly, calmly and in the correct way.

These incidents can cause huge \\nlosses from collapsed buildings, damaged crops to large number of human casualties . \\nSometimes disasters strike suddenly. \\nRendering of first aid to the victims affected by a disaster is a very important relief activity and \\nis a part of the first aid training programmes. Mass casualty management stresses the \\nimportance of the role of firs t responders and first aiders in disaster relief and counts on their \\npreparedness to respond to emergency situations. \\nIn recent years, there has been renewed realizations that the people who become victim of \\ninjury or sudden illness need not only immediate  attention but also proper medical care. Thus , \\nit is imperative that first aid training and practice should keep pace with modem medical \\nadvancements.  \\nUnfortunately, many human lives are lost or disturbed by disasters and accidents. These stressful \\nlife e vents should be supported by appropriate and timely psychological aid. It is very \\nimportant that someone is helping in making necessary arrangements, giving practical advice, \\nlistening to the grievances, assuaging the feelings and providing physical comfor t by being \\nwith them. It is also important to educate victims about stress reactions and where to refer to \\nfor further help. These tasks do not require a psychologist, but trained first aiders can assist \\nsupporting these victims. \\nFor smooth working at a disaster or mass casualty accident site the first aiders need to:  \\n\\uf0a7 Have the appropriate knowledge and training in first aid and disaster \\nmanagement. \\n\\uf0a7 Have the capability to think practically and be able to improvise, if required. \\n\\uf0a7 Obtain the full particulars nature of the accident or disaster and the affected site. \\n\\uf0a7 Coordinate with the appropriate governmental authorities. \\n\\uf0a7 Coordinate with other local agencies, other institutions or organizations. \\n\\uf0a7 List the resources (transport capacit y, available medical personnel, available  first \\nresponders and first aiders, stand by medical equipment, available medication \\nsupplies, available equipment and disaster relief materials,  etc.) he has at his \\ndisposal and have an estimate how fast he can mobilize these resources. \\n\\uf0a7 Obtain permission to act from the superior officer on site. \\n\\uf0a7 Survey the site, the situation and the security risks. \\n\\uf0a7 Survey the casualties. \\n\\uf0a7 Allot the priorities for treatment and transport of the casualties. \\n\\uf0a7 Provide the necessary assistance. \\n\\uf0a7 Treat and transport the casualties to the assigned medical facilities. \\n\\uf0a7 Submit a daily report to the concerned authorities and to his organization. \\n\\uf0a7 Submit on completion of the mission a detailed final report to the concerned local \\nauthorities as we ll as his St. John Ambulance Headquarters or to his Red Cross \\nSociety along with his observations and suggestions.'),\n",

In medicine, this is the process \\nof sorting casualties in order of priority for treatment and evacuation. Triage may take many \\ndifferent forms, and operates at a number of different levels. However, it aims to give the right \\ninjured the right care at the right time in the right place. \\nIn certain circumstances , this may also mean ‘doing the most for the most’. Originally \\ndeveloped for use in military conflicts, triage is equally applicable to civilian disasters and in \\nday-to-day emergency settings. Accurate triage allows correct identification of those \\ncasualties who need the most urgent intervention, as well as quickly and safely identifying those \\nwho can wait longer for treatment. The latter are the majority at a typical major incident. Triage \\nmay also be used to identify casualties who are so severely injured that they will not survive, or \\nwhose treatment will tie up resources that would be best used for other injured. \\nTriage is dynamic ‒ as the person’s condition progresses, so his/her need for intervention alters, \\nand the triage category will change. \\nThe casualties are classified in different categories: \\nCategory \\uf0e0 RED \\n(U1 or I) \\nYELLOW \\n(U2 or II) \\nGREEN \\n(U3 or III) \\nBLACK \\nUrgency Extremely \\nurgent. \\nFast treatment  \\nneeded. \\nConstant follow \\nup of breathing \\nand circulation \\nrequired. \\nNon urgent \\ntreatment. \\nDeceased. \\nInjuries Life-threatening \\ninjuries. \\nSevere. \\nNot immediately \\nlife-threatening. \\nLocalised \\ninjuries. \\nNon-life-\\nthreatening. \\nFatal injuries. \\nCondition Cardiac arrest. \\nHypoxia. \\nShock. \\nLife- threatening \\nbleeding. \\nRelatively stable \\ncondition. \\nBleeding under \\ncontrol. \\nBreathing. \\nWalking \\nwounded. \\nNo respiration. \\nNo pulse. \\nCPR \\nunsuccessful. \\nSurvival rate Low if no urgent \\nmedical \\ntreatment. \\nBetter if medical \\ntreatment \\navailable. \\nGood when \\ntimely medical \\ntreatment is \\nprovided. \\nHigh.

They are \\nvictims of the incident but seem not to be injured. \\n\\uf0a7 Inside each category, i.e. the categories RED and YE LLOW, all casualties of the \\nsame are again ‘categorized by urgency’. For example, casualties with difficult \\nbreathing in category YELLOW will be attended first before casualties in the same \\ncategory with a better condition. \\n\\uf0a7 Triaging is a snapshot of the moment the victim has been evaluated. Victims of one \\ncategory can move in between categories. For example, a person in category \\nGREEN was walking around, but due to an internal bleeding his condition \\ndeteriorates and he becomes a category YELLOW, even RED, d epending on his \\n‘new’ condition.  \\n\\uf0a7 In a mass casualty incident assigning the triage category is done very quickly. The \\ncategory ‘BLACK’ (deceased) may be assigned to all casualties that are not \\nbreathing without even a CPR attempt (as incident is so massive and there are too \\nmany casualties that have to be attended with very limited resources). When more \\nhelp arrives, and if the situation allows, these victims might be re-evaluated.  \\n\\uf0a7 In most mass casualty disasters, a zone for the RED (U1), YELLOW (U2) and G REEN \\n(U3), the deceased (BLACK) and non-wounded (BLUE) will be assigned.  \\n\\uf0a7 Always make sure somebody is also observing the casualties in the GREEN zone and \\nthe non-wounded (BLUE) as some signs and symptoms of an injury may only show \\nover time.'),\n",

These are made from flannel, calico and elastic net or special paper.  \\nIf you have no bandage available, you can improvise one from an everyday item; for example, \\nyou can fold a square of fabric, such as a headscarf, diagonally to make a triangular bandage, \\nand a roller bandage if further folded. A belt, tie or some other materials can also be used as \\nan improvised bandage. \\nBandages should be applied firm enough to keep dressing and splints in positi on, but not as \\ntight as to cause injury to the part or to impede the circulation of the blood. A bluish ting e of \\nthe finger or nails may be a danger sign indicating that the bandage  is too tight. Loss of \\nsensation is another sign; such bandages should be loosened or removed quickly. \\nO.2.1 TYPES OF BANDAGES  \\nThere are several types of bandages.  \\n\\uf0a7 Triangular bandages (also referred to as “master bandage”) can be used as large \\ndressings, or as slings, to secure dressings or to immobilize limbs. \\n\\uf0a7 Roller and crepe bandages secure dressings and support injured limbs.  \\n\\uf0a7 Tubular bandages hold dressings on fingers or toes or support injured joints.  \\nO.2.1.1 TRIANGULAR BANDAGES \\n \\nA triangular bandage is made by cutting a piece of calico about 100 cm square from corner \\nto corner giving two triangular bandages.  \\nIt has three borders. The longest is called the “ base” and the other two the “ sides”. There are \\nthree corners. The one opposite the base is called the “point” and the other two are called the \\n“ends”. While applying a triangular bandage, the point always moves first.'),\n",

Face the casualty, hold the bandage point firm ly and put one end of the spread \\ntriangular bandage over the uninjured shoulder with point towards the elbow of the \\ninjured side. \\n2. Pass the end around the neck and bring it over the injured side shoulder. The other \\nend will now be hanging down over the chest. \\n3. Place the forearm horizontally across the chest  at 90° and bring the hanging end \\nup. The forearm is now covered by the bandage. \\n \\n4. Tie the two ends in such a way that the forearm is horizontal or slightly tilted upward \\nand the knot (reef knot) is placed in the pit above the collar-bone. \\n5. Hold the point with one hand & the bandage at little finger with the other and \\nstretch it tight to check for any object like Bangle, watch or metal ring etc. beneath \\nthe bandage. \\n6. Tuck the part of the sling point which is loose at the elbow behind the elbow and \\nbring the fold to the front and pin it up to the front of the bandage. \\n7. Place the free base of the bandage in such a way that its margin is just at the base \\nof the nail of the little finger. The nails of all the fingers should be exposed.'),\n",

If the casualty is not wearing a coat, place a soft pad under the neck portion of \\nthe sling to prevent rubbing of the skin in that place. \\nO.2.1.2.2 COLLAR ‘N’ CUFF SLING \\nThis sling is only used to support the wrist. \\n \\nTo apply a collar-N-cuff sling: \\n1. The elbow is bent; the forearm is placed across the chest in such a way that the \\nfingers point the opposite shoulder. In this position the sling is applied. \\n2. A clove hitch is made with narrow bandage. Two loops are made and are laid on \\ntop of the other, the front loop is laid behind the back loop without turning. \\n3. A clove-hitch is passed round the wrist and the ends tied in the neck pit above the \\ncollarbone on the injured side.  \\nO.2.1.2.3 TRIANGULAR SLING (WITH UNDERARM UPWARDS)  \\nA triangular sling is used to support the fracture of the collar bone, arms or injured shoulder, and \\nalso crushed or badly burned palms.

In general principle \\nthey are similar. \\n \\nA stretcher consists of following parts \\n\\uf0a7 poles,  \\n\\uf0a7 handles,  \\n\\uf0a7 jointed traverses,  \\n\\uf0a7 runners,  \\n\\uf0a7 bed,  \\n\\uf0a7 pillow-sack, and  \\n\\uf0a7 slings.  \\nThe \\'head\\' and \\'foot\\' of a stretcher correspond to the head and feet of the casualty. \\nAt the head of the stretcher may be a canvas overlay (the pillow sack) which can be filled with \\nstraw, hay, clothing etc. to form a pillow. The pillow - sack opens at the head and its contents \\ncan therefore be adjusted without due disturbance of the casualty.  \\nThe traverses are provided with joints for opening or closing the stretcher.  \\nThe telescopic-handled pattern is similar but its length can be reduced to 6 feet by sliding the \\nhandles underneath the poles. This is of a great value when working in confined space, or when \\na casualty has to be taken up or down a narrow stair-case with sharp turns. \\nWhen closed, the poles of the stretcher lie close together, the transverse bars being bent \\ninwards, the canvas bed neatly folded on the top of the poles and held in position by the slings, \\nwhich are laid along with canvas and secured by a strap which is placed transversely at the \\nend of each sling and passed through the large loop of the other, and round the poles and \\nbed. \\nO.5.1 LOADING A STRETCHER  \\nTwo methods are used to load a person on a stretcher: \\n\\uf0a7 blanket lift, and \\n\\uf0a7 emergency lift.'),\n",

Prepare the stretcher; the soft bed of the canvas type of stretcher must be stiffened, \\npreferably by placing short boards across the stretchers, or long ones lengthwise on \\nthe canvas if only these are available. If no stretcher is available, a narrow shutter, \\ndoor or board of at least the same width and length as the person may be used. \\n2. Cover the stretcher with a folded blanket and then blanket the stretcher. \\nPlace pillows or pads in readiness on the stretcher in a position to support the neck, \\nand small part of the back. Those should be sufficiently large, but not too large, to \\npreserve the normal curves of the spine. \\n3. Whenever the casualty is to be moved or lifted he must not be bent, twisted or over \\nextended. One bearer must apply firm but gentle support to the head and face, \\nso as to prevent neck movement and another bearer must steady and support the \\nlower limbs to prevent trunk movement. This must be continued until the casualty \\nhas been placed on the stretcher. \\n4. When the casualty is not already lying on a blanket or rug. \\na. Place the blanket or rug on the ground in line with the ca sualty, and rolled \\nlengthwise for half its width. \\nb. While the two bearers maintain control of the head and lower limbs, other \\nbearers very carefully turn the casualty on to his side every precaution being \\ntaken against movement at the site of the fracture. P lace the roller portion of \\nthe blanket or rug close to the casualty's back and gently rolls him over the roll \\nuntil he is lying on his opposite side. Unroll the rolled portion of the blanket or \\nrug gently lowering the casualty on his back so that he lies on the centre of the \\nopen blanket or rug. The bearers at the head and at the lower limbs conform \\nto the rolling of the casualty throughout. \\n5. Loading the stretcher.  \\nThere are two methods of loading a stretcher- a standard method (when there is a \\nblanket under the casualty), and an emergency method (when there is no blanket \\nunder the casualty), in which case the stretcher can be pushed under the casualty \\nfor that it will be necessary for the bearer at the feet to keep his legs wide apart to \\nallow the stretcher to be placed between them. \\na. “Blanket lift” is the standard method for loading cases of fractures of the spine \\nwhen there is blanket under the casualty. \\nRoll the two edges of the blanket up against the casualty's side.  \\nIf poles of sufficient length and rig idity are available the edges of the blanket \\nshould be rolled around them. This will make the lifting of the casualty very \\nmuch easier.\"),\n",

The “Emergency method” for loading fractures of the spine is used when there \\nis no blanket under the casualty and none is available. \\nOpen out the casualty jacket and roll it firmly so that the rolls are close to each \\nside.  \\nPlace the casualty on the stretcher adopting the same procedure as described \\nfor the blanket lift method except that the bearers grasp the rolled up jacket \\nand/or the clothing and /or bandage round the casualty's thighs instead of the \\nrolled edges of the blanket. When the clothing is insecure, a broad bandage \\nmust be placed round the body just below the shoulder for the bearers to \\ngrasp. \\n6. In the case of cervical injuries, place firm supports such as rolled -up blanket s or \\nsandbags on each side of the head to steady it. \\n7. Place a folded blanket in the hollow above the heels so as to relieve pressure on \\nthem. \\n8. Wrap the casualty. \\n9. If he is to be carried over rough ground, reduce his body movements to a minimum \\nby binding him firmly but not too tightly to the stretcher, with broad bandages. \\nThese should be applied round the pelvis, thighs and calves, and round the body \\nand arms, just above the elbows. \\n10. On reaching the shelter, medical facility or hospital, do nothing further unt il the \\narrival of medical aid.  \\n11.

A casualty without a clear airway or who is not \\nbreathing may die from lack of oxygen. Excessive loss of blood \\nmay lead to shock, and shock can lead to death; therefore, you \\nmust act immediately to control the loss of blood. All wounds \\nare considered to be contaminated, since infection-producing \\norganism (germs) are always present on the skin and clothing, \\nand in the soil, water, and air. Any missile or instrument (such \\nas bullet, shrapnel, knife, or bayonet) causing a wound pushes \\nor carries germs into that wound. Infection results as these \\norganism multiply. That a wound is contaminated does not \\nlessen the importance of protecting it from further as soon as \\npossible to prevent further contamination\\nOPEN THE AIRW AY AND RESTORE BREATHING\\n When a victim is unconscious, all muscles are relaxed. \\nIf the victim is left on the back, the tongue, which is attached \\nto the back of the jaw, falls against the back wall of the throat \\nand blocks air from entering the lungs. Other soft tissues \\nof the airway may worsen this obstruction. The mouth falls \\nopen but this tend to block, rather than open, the airway. The \\nunconscious victim is further a risk because of being unable \\nto swallow or cough out foreign material in the airway. This \\nmay cause airway obstruction, or laryngeal irritation and \\nforeign material may enter the lungs. For this reason the \\nrescuer should not given an unconscious victim anything by \\nmouth, and should not attempt to induce vomiting.\\nKey point:\\n In an unconscious victim, care of the airway takes \\nprecedence over any injury, including the possibilities of \\nspinal injury. Airway management is high priority. It is \\nimportant to check the airway before the breathing. If air \\ncannot enter the lungs due to some sort of blockage, the \\ncasualty will not survive for long.\\nAirway management is required to provide an open \\nairway when the victim:\\n l Is unconscious;\\n l Has an obstructed airway;\\n l Needs rescue breathing.\\nAlways obstruction:\\nIf during resuscitation the airway becomes \\ncompromised, the victim should be promptly rolled onto'),\n",

The victim should then be \\nreassessed for responsiveness and normal breathing. Most \\nairway problems are caused by the tongue and/or vomit. \\nThese can often be resolved by simple airway management.\\nTong u e:\\nThe muscle tone of the upper airway is directly \\nrelated to the responsiveness: when sleeping, for example; \\nminor degree of reduced muscle tone may lead to sufficient \\nobstruction to cause snoring. When unresponsive, however, \\nthis obstruction can become complete and fatal.\\nVomit:\\nFoot remains in our stomach for hours, so most \\nvictims will have food in their stomachs, and it is possible \\nfor this food to regurgitate up from the stomach into the \\nlungs. This is called aspiration. The acidity of the stomach \\ncontents and the particles size can block and damage the \\nairway. Regurgitation is a passive process caused by a rise \\nin stomach pressure overcoming the sphincter. It is usually \\ncaused by a full gut, obesity, (weight on the stomach) or air.\\nHow to check an Airway:\\n l Open the mouth and look for foreign objects\\n l Finger sweep (only if an object can be seen and can \\nremoved with a sweep of a gloved finger)\\n l Perform a “Head-tilt, chin-lift” .\\nHead-tilt, chin-lift:\\nAdults and children (a \\nchild is define as one \\nyear to eight years of \\nage).\\nOne hand is placed on \\nthe forehead or the top \\nof the head. The other hand is used to provide chin lift. The \\nhead is tilted backwards without placing your hand under \\nthe neck. It is important to avoid excessive force, especially \\nwhere neck injury is suspected. Make sure that you are \\nwearing barrier gloves.\\nChin lift is common used in conjunction with \\nBackward head Tilt. \\nThe chin is held up by \\nthe rescuer’s thumb and \\nfingers in order to open \\nthe mouth and pull the \\ntongue and soft tissues'),\n",

One technique involves \\nplacing the thumb over the chin below the lip and supporting \\nthe tip of the jaw with the middle finger and the index finger \\nalong the jaw lines. Care is required to prevent the ring finger \\nfrom compressing the soft tissues of the neck. The jaw is held \\nopen slightly and pulled away from the chest.\\nFinger sweep:\\nThe finger is used to clear the mouth of fluid and \\ndebris in the unresponsive casualty. It should only be \\nperformed if you can see something to remove. It should \\nalways be performed with a gloved hand with the casualty \\npositioned on their side in a stable side position. Insert your \\nfirst finger into the high into the side of the casualty’s mouth \\nand perform a single sweeping motion to the opposite side, \\nflicking out vomit, blood, and debris.\\nInfants: An infant is define as younger than one year.\\nThe upper airway in infants is easily to obstructed because \\nof the narrow nasal passages, the entrance to the windpipe \\n(vocal cords) and the trachea (windpipe).

VANDEKERCKHOVE  \\n \\n  \\nDear reader of this Indian First Aid Manual,  \\n  \\nFirst aid techniques taught to people across the globe vary widely – or maybe it’s best to say: \\n‘used to vary widely’. The main reason for these different kinds of first aid manuals or guidelines \\nis the fact that they are not always based on scientific evi dence. This also means that they do \\nnot necessarily describe the most effective first aid techniques.   \\n  \\nThat is also the very reason why, in 2006, the Belgian Red Cross (Flanders) decided to harmonise \\nthe traditional European first aid guidelines and bas e them on research and international \\ndirectives.  As a result, the European First Aid Manual (EFAM), now in its second edition, was \\ncreated and updated using the latest medical and scientific information.   \\n  \\nSeveral African Red Cross Societies expressed their interest in a similar science-based first aid \\nmanual adapted to the African context. Belgian Red Cross (Flanders) helped to formulate these \\ncontextualised guidelines in 2009, resulting in the publication of the African First Aid Manual \\n(AFAM).   \\n  \\nThe development of the Indian First Aid Guidelines (IFAG) was the logical next step. IFAG was \\npublicised at the end of 2014.  These guidelines, combined with the most recent international \\nfirst aid guideline-recommendations (ILCOR 2015), formed the basis of the new Indian First Aid \\nManual (IFAM). The manual is used by St John Ambulance (India) and the Indian Red Cross \\nSociety.   \\n  \\nIFAM is available to more than 1.2 billion Indian laypeople meaning that all these people can \\nlearn the most recent, evidence-based first aid techniques adapted to the Indian way of life.  I \\nam convinced that, with IFAM and thanks to the efforts of the Indian Red Cross Society and St \\nJohn Ambulance (India), we can reduce the burden of injuries and diseases in India.  \\n  \\nI hope you enjoy reading and learning from this manual.'),\n",

GOYAL \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThis evidence based first aid manual prepared by the National Headquarters in coordination \\nwith Belgian Red Cross is published on behalf of the Indian Red Cross Society and St. John \\nAmbulance (India). \\nAs the developments and knowledge has grown, the method of rendering first -aid have \\nchanged and now there is universal understanding on giving first -aid to people suffering from \\nvarious kinds of injuries or illness.  \\nFirst–Aid treatment is in practice ever since the inception of history of “Service of Mankind”. In \\nIndia Historical evidences of rendering first -aid to the sick and wounded are on record. Some \\nsuch glaring instances are Wars of Mahabharta, Mughals, Sikhs and during natural or \\nmanmade calamities. \\nThe Mission of mercy of the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi when he donned the Khaki \\nArmy uniform and collected an ambulance corps of 1100 dedicated volunteers in 1899 during \\nBoer War and 1906 Rebellion War and brought help and succour to many a wounded soldiers. \\nSt. John Ambulance, as is known world over, is the pioneering organization recognized in the \\nfield of training in first-aid and allied subjects. \\nBest efforts have been made in bringing this manual  in line with the present requirement and \\nthe suggestions received from the State and Union Territory Centres / branches.  \\nThis manual will go a long way in educating and guiding the members of the general public in \\nhelping the sick and injured on the basis of authentic and authoritative guidelines.    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nS.C.

AGARWAL \\n \\nFirst aid training is a low cost, but highly effective strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality.  \\nWith the help of Belgia n Red Cross Centre for Evidence -Based Practice (CEBaP), Belgian Red \\nCross-Flanders and a multi -disciplinary expert panel, Indian Red Cross Society prepared the \\nevidence-based Indian First Aid Guidelines (IFAG) in 2014 which were used to update the sixth \\nedition of first a id Manual prepared for the general public by the St. John Ambulance (India) \\nand the Indian Red Cross Society. \\nFirst aid has been practised in the world since antiquity. There is enough evidence that it was \\nused to give relief to the injured and sick persons in wars and calamities in India since the times \\nof Mahabarata. The use of first aid techniques expanded and improved with time, but it got \\nthe real fillip when the Red Cross Movement started in the world about 150 years ago. \\nConsequently, The Indian Red Cross Society was established in 1920 through an Act of the \\nParliament. Until then, the St. John Ambulance carried out Red Cross work in addition to its \\nnormal activities. \\nTo provide the right and effective help before a trained health worker is available or the victim \\nreaches a health facility, it needs to be given by the laypersons who happen to be present \\nwherever a person suffers from an injury or illness. This will only be possible when a large number \\nof laypeople are trained in evidence-based first aid techniques. Presently, about 6 lakh persons \\nare trained in India every year in the basic first aid. The number looks impressive, but is not \\nadequate considering the huge population and vast area not having good communication \\nfacilities. \\nThis seventh edition of the Indian First Aid Manual (IFAM) has several new and updated features. \\nA brief on anatomy and physiology has been provided on each system. The chapter on cardio \\npulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has been completely revised. More emphas is has been put on \\nchest compression to ensure improvement in the blood supply to heart and brain, and use of \\ndirect pressure to the site of bleeding to control further bleeding. A chapter on hand  washing \\nhas been added to prevent the transmission of infections between the victim and first aiders. \\nGuidelines related to snake bites have been totally revised considering the after effects of \\ntourniquet binding. Useful guidelines have been added for important public health problems \\nsuch as diarrhoea, fever, diabetes, emergency childbirth etc. which still claim many lives.  \\nI am convinced  the new Manual will be immensely useful for the laypersons as well as \\nhealthcare workers to understand the evidence -based techniques of first a id which are \\nbecoming more and  more crucial in saving life in this era when the country is facing an \\nepidemic of roadside accidents. \\n \\nDr. S.P.Agarwal \\nSecretary General \\nIndian Red Cross Society  \\nSt. John Ambulance (India)'),\n",

Being laymen in the field of medicine, \\nit is expected that they will practice the basic principles of first aid and render such aid needed \\nby the casualty (casualties) till medical aid arrives or the person(s) has (have) been transported \\nto the hospital. The basic characteristic of this manual is to make the layman competent in the \\nsubject. \\nThe first aid guidelines in this manual have been based on the latest available and accessible \\nscientific and medical knowledge. In 2014 , a team of Indian medical and first aid specialists \\npublicised the Indian Firs t Aid Guideli nes (IFAG) . These guidelines are developed using a \\nrigorous and transparent methodology to overcome potential biases; are based on extensive \\nresearch, data analysis and reviews; and are specifically adapted to be implemented within \\nthe Indian context.  The se guidelines are further complemented by the 2015 guidelines on \\nresuscitation and fi rst aid as published by International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation \\n(ILCOR) and the American Heart Association (AHA). The first aid guidelines and implementation \\nconsiderations compiled by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent \\nSocieties (IFRC) (2016) were deliberated . The editorial board reviewed the applicability of \\navailable first aid guidelines int o the specific Indian context and rephrased or adapted them \\naccordingly. For interventions w here neither IFAG nor international first aid g uidelines existed, \\nor in case sufficient or scientifically evidence was not available, the editorial board decided to \\ninclude the commonly applied first aid practices.  \\nIn the first chapter this manual specifies in detail what “first aid” is about and how to deal with \\nan emergency. It further includes basic first aid techniques the first aider should master, i.e. \\nobserving vital signs and consciousness; cardiopulmonary resusci tation (CPR); recovery \\nposition; the first assessment of a casualty, and the hand washing technique. \\nThe subsequent chapters describe a more in-depth first aid approach and techniques.  \\nThe structure of these chapters is: \\n\\uf0a7 Each chapter begins with a short overview of the anatomy and physiology.  \\n\\uf0a7 For specific situation or condition, a list of signs and symptoms a lay person may \\nobserve and recognize are included in the section ‘What do I see and enquire?’ \\n\\uf0a7 This section is immediately followed by ‘What do I do?’ listing a sequence of first \\naid guidelines and techniques appropriate for that situation or condition. \\nDrawings support the student/reader in understanding specific positions, \\ntechniques or signs.  \\nThe list of guidelines and techniques is completed with a section on ‘ When to \\nrefer the casualty to a healthcare facility?’. Please note all casualties should best \\nconsult a medical caregiver in all cases.  \\nIf (urgent) patient transport is required, this is indicated by       .   \\nIf the casualty normally does not require organized (ambulance) transport for \\nfurther treatment, it is marked with the sign      .  \\nHowever, depending on the specific situation, condition of the person and \\nseverity of the injury or sickness, (ambulance) transport or even urgent transport \\nmight be required: the first aider needs to consider all elements on when and \\nhow a casualty needs to seek further medical help. In case of doubt, it is always \\nbetter to arrange (urgent) transport to the healthcare facility for further medical \\ntreatment.'),\n",

If the reason is a disease or \\nillness, the term ‘sick person’ is used. \\nThe guidelines and instructions are intended to be applied on  both male and female \\ncasualties. To make the reading easier,  and instead of writing ‘he/she’ , we opted to use the \\npronoun ‘he’ meaning that the guideline or instruction is applicable both for male  and for \\nfemale victims. Only if the intervention is specifically applicable to females, we use ‘she’ in the \\ninstructions.  \\nThis manual is limited in describing  the guidelines, interventions and techniques in words and \\npictures only. To acquire  a practical knowledge  it is important to practice these  techniques \\nand specifically to practice  the basic first aid techniques ( e.g. cardiopulmonary resuscitation \\n(CPR), how to put a person into recovery position , etc.) frequently. First aid courses organized \\nby the Indian Red Cross Society and the St John Ambulance Ass ociation India are ideal \\nopportunities in achieving a clear insight in these techniques and allows to exercise the theory \\ninto practice via simulation and on dummies. \\nThe trained first aider is advised to refresh his first aid knowledge by reviewing the guidelines \\nand techniques regularly in this manual and to practice them very frequently.  \\nThe medical science is constantly in evolution. Newer scientific insights might have an influence \\non the approach of casualties by lay people and on the first aid guidelines and techniques. \\nThis manual is scheduled to be reviewed and updated every five years ; the next review is \\nscheduled in 2021.'),\n",

The guidelines are to be followed by hospita ls, police \\nand other authorities for the protection of Good Samaritans.  The Supreme C ourt approved \\nthese guidelines on 30 March 2016, making them law of the land and binding to all states. \\nFollowing guidelines are included (sub-selection of the guidelines): \\n1. A bystander or Good Samaritan, including an eyewitness of a road accident , may \\ntake an injured to the nearest hospital and should be allowed to leave immediately. \\nNo questions are to be asked. An eyewitness has to provide his address.  \\n2. The bys tander or Good Samaritan shall not be liable for any civil and criminal \\nliability. \\n3. A bystander or Good Samaritan who makes a phone call to inform the police or \\nemergency services for the person lying injured on the road cannot be compelled \\nto give his name  or personal details on the phone or in person. The disclosure of \\ncontact details of the Good Samaritan is to be voluntary. \\n4. The lack of response by a  doctor in an emergency pertaining to road accidents \\n(where he is expected to provide care) shall constitute ‘Professional Misconduct’. \\nB.2.2 DUTY OF GIVING CARE  \\nUsually, if a volunteer comes to the aid of an injured or sick person who is a stranger, the person \\ngiving the aid owes the stranger a duty of being reasonably careful.  \\nIn relation to the “duty of giving care”, there is currently (2015) no legal obligation for first aiders \\nto provide first aid in a general public context, not unless it's part of a job description. First aid \\nofficers in workplaces and school teachers have a duty of care. \\nOnce a first aider begins to provide first aid, a duty of care is established and the first aider then \\nhas an obligation to fulfil the duty of care.  \\nIf a road user is involved in an accident, there is a legal requirement to stay at the scene, assist \\nthe injured and report the incident to the police. \\nNot fulfilling a duty of giving care leaves the first aider open to questions of negligence. Whilst \\nthere is no law that forces anyone to treat a casualty this does not mean that one can simply \\nleave a casualty who you know is in d anger.  To do so may make you liable through your \\nomission to act.   If you are not happy to provide first aid there are several things you can and \\nshould do including (but not limited to):  \\n\\uf0a7 inform someone else, such as the police or the emergency services; \\n\\uf0a7 make the area around the casualty safe for yourself, others and the casualty; \\n\\uf0a7 monitor the casualty and/or find out what happened; and \\n\\uf0a7 comfort the casualty.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\FA-manual-1.pdf'}, page_content='21 \\nB.2.3 CONSENT OF THE PERSON  IN NEED \\nA conscious person has the right to either refuse or accept care. If the person is conscious, you \\nmust ask for his consent before commencing any first aid. If he refuses your help, stay nearby \\nand call the police and emergency services, who can then deal with the situation.  \\nIf the person is under 18, it is best to obtain c onsent from his parent or guardian if they are \\npresent. If they refuse your help, stay nearby and call the police and the emergency services, \\nwho can then deal with the situation. \\nIf the person is unconscious or unable to formally consent, his consent is inferred and you can \\nthen give the necessary first aid. \\nB.2.4 PRIVACY \\nIn any first aid situation, the first aider must take steps to assist the person to maintain personal \\nprivacy. This means things like, keeping crowds away, putting up a screen if necessary, and  \\ncovering any exposed body parts with blankets, or sheets, if available.  \\nThe first aider also needs to take steps to maintain confidentiality. This means not talking about \\nthe incident to other people, or answering questions from the media, unless you have  \\npermission from the person involved in the accident. \\nB.2.5 NEGLIGENCE  \\nIf a volunteer comes to the aid of an injured or sick person who is a stranger, the person giving \\nthe aid owes the stranger a duty of being reasonably careful.  \\nNot fulfilling, or breaking a duty of care leaves the first aider open to questions of negligence.  \\nIt is unlikely that a first aider would be sued as long as not practiced outside the parameters of \\nthe techniques taught at the first aid training.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\FA-manual-1.pdf'}, page_content='22 \\nB.3 DEALING WITH AN EMERGENCY \\nEmergency situations vary greatly but there are four main steps that always apply: \\n1. Make the area safe. \\n2. Evaluate the injured person’s condition. \\n3. Seek help. \\n4. Give first aid. \\nB.3.1 STEP 1: MAKE THE AREA SAFE \\nYour own safety should always come first.  \\nAs a first aider, you should: \\n\\uf0a7 try to find out what has just happened; \\n\\uf0a7 check for any danger (is there a threat from traffic, fire, electricity cables, etc.?); \\n\\uf0a7 never approach the scene of an accident if you are putting yourself in danger; \\n\\uf0a7 do your best to protect both the injured person(s) and other people on the scene; \\n\\uf0a7 be aware that the property of the injured person is at risk. Theft can occur. So mind \\nyour safety, and \\n\\uf0a7 seek police or emergency help if an accident scene is unsafe and you cannot offer \\nhelp without putting yourself in danger. \\nAn important part of safety also includes washing your hands and wearing gloves or \\na protection when coming in contact with the injured or sick person’s blood or body \\nfluids.  \\nIn case of road accidents, as a first aider, you should: \\n\\uf0a7 always follow the traffic rules; \\n\\uf0a7 ask other people to warn traffic about the event; \\n\\uf0a7 if possible, place a warning sign at a good distance, at least 30 meters to either side \\nof the accident, to warn traffic. Do not forget to remo ve the warning signs \\nafterwards; \\n\\uf0a7 seek help from the police or emergency services; \\n\\uf0a7 not allow anybody to smoke near an accident site; \\n\\uf0a7 switch off the engine of every car involved in the accident; and'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\FA-manual-1.pdf'}, page_content='23 \\n\\uf0a7 try to apply the handbrake of vehicles involved in the accident to prevent them \\nfrom moving. You can also put something against the tyres to prevent rolling. \\n \\nAs a general rule, the injured person should not be moved from the scene of an accident. \\nAny movement may make the injury worse if there has been a head, neck, back, and leg or \\narm injury. \\nOnly move injured people if: \\n\\uf0a7 the injured person is in more danger if he is left there, \\n\\uf0a7 the situation cannot be made safe, \\n\\uf0a7 medical help will not arrive soon, and \\n\\uf0a7 you can do so without putting yourself in danger. \\nB.3.2 STEP 2: EVALUATE THE CONDITION OF THE SICK OR INJURED PERSON \\nIf it is safe, you can evaluate the sick  or injured person’s condition. Always check that he is \\nconscious and breathing normally. Situations in which consciousness or breathing are \\nimpaired are often life threatening.  \\nBleeding can also happen inside the body and can be life-threatening although the loss of \\nblood is not seen.  \\nTechniques of resuscitation (CPR), the recovery position, etc. are explained in this manual. \\nB.3.3 STEP 3: SEEK HELP \\n \\nOnce you have evaluated the sick  or injured person’s condition you can decide if help is \\nneeded urgently. \\nIf help is needed, ask a bystander to call for help. Ask him to come back and confirm that help \\nis underway.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\FA-manual-1.pdf'}, page_content='24 \\nIf you call for help, be prepared to have the following information available: \\n\\uf0a7 the location where the help is required (address, street, specific reference points, \\nlocation;  if in a building: floor, room); \\n\\uf0a7 the telephone or mobile number you are calling from; \\n\\uf0a7 the nature of the problem; \\n\\uf0a7 what happened (car accident, fall, sudden illness, explosion, …); \\n\\uf0a7 how many injured;  \\n\\uf0a7 nature of the injuries (if you know); \\n\\uf0a7 what type of help is needed: \\n\\uf0a7 ambulance, \\n\\uf0a7 police, \\n\\uf0a7 fire brigade, or \\n\\uf0a7 other services; \\n\\uf0a7 and any other information that might help. \\nYou might be asked to give your name. Always stay calm and answer their questions calmly. \\nThe call takers are professionals and will give you further guidance. \\nIf an ambulance can be obtained in a short time, it is best to call for one and use it to \\ntransport the injured or sick person to the healthcare facility. An ambulance is the best way \\nto transport ill or injured persons, but they are not always and everywhere quickly available. \\nYou can always ask the police for help. \\nIf no help is available, you will have to arrange transport yourself (in a van, a truck, a car, an \\nauto-rickshaw, a motorbike, a scooter, a bike-rickshaw, a bike...). Always move the sick  or \\ninjured person with great care. \\nB.3.4 STEP 4: PROVIDE FIRST AID \\nGive first aid in accordance with the instructions given in the following chapters in this manual. \\nWhen providing first aid, try to protect an ill or injured person from cold and heat. \\nDo not give anything to eat or drink to a person who is: \\n\\uf0a7 severely injured, \\n\\uf0a7 feeling nausea, \\n\\uf0a7 becoming sleepy, or  \\n\\uf0a7 falling unconscious. \\nIn fact, as a general principle, the rule is not to give a casualty anything to drink or \\neat. Important exceptions include hypothermia (low body temperature), \\nhypoglycaemic shock (low blood sugar in a diabetes patient) , diarrhoea and fever \\nleading to dehydration and in case of heat exhaustion or heatstroke; and only if the \\nperson is conscious .  The details can be reviewed in the specific  chapters on these \\nconditions.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\FA-manual-1.pdf'}, page_content='25 \\nBe aware that experiencing an emergency situation is a very stressful experience for the \\ninjured or sick person. \\nTo support him through the ordeal, follow these simple tips: \\n\\uf0a7 tell the sick or injured person your name, explain how you are going to help him and \\nreassure him. This will help to relax him; \\n\\uf0a7 listen to the person and show concern and kindness; \\n\\uf0a7 make him as comfortable as possible; \\n\\uf0a7 if he is worried, tell him that it is normal to be afraid; \\n\\uf0a7 if it is safe to do so, encourage family and loved ones to stay with him; and \\n\\uf0a7 explain to the sick or injured person what has happened and what is going to happen. \\nB.3.5 WHEN CAN I STOP PROVIDING FIRST  AID? \\nThe question arises when your first aid ‘duty’ comes to an end?  \\nWithin first aid, CPR is a lifesaving activity. But when you can stop giving CPR?  There are four \\nreasons allowing you to stop CPR: \\n\\uf0a7 you see a sign of life, such as breathing; \\n\\uf0a7 someone trained in first aid or a medical professional takes over;  \\n\\uf0a7 you are too exhausted to continue; or  \\n\\uf0a7 the scene becomes unsafe for you to continue.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\FA-manual-1.pdf'}, page_content='26 \\nB.4 STRESS WHEN GIVING FIRST AID \\nIt is only normal to feel stress if you are suddenly faced with the need to give first aid in a  real \\nemergency.  \\nTry to bring your emotions under control before you proceed. You may  take some  time to \\nstand back from the situation and regain your calm. Do not set about the task too hastily and \\ndo not under any circumstances place your own safety at risk. \\nIt is not always easy to process a traumatic event emotionally. It is not unusual for first aiders to \\nexperience difficulty when working through their emotions afterwards. Talk to your friends, \\nfamily, fellow first aiders or someone else. If you are still worried, talk to a professional and seek \\ncounselling.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\FA-manual-1.pdf'}, page_content='27 \\nB.5 RESUSCITATION (BASIC CPR) \\nReviving someone who is unconscious and/or not breathing or not breathing normally is called \\nresuscitation.  \\nIf the victim is not breathing or is not breat hing normally, any source of suffocation should be \\nremoved and resuscitation is to be started. \\nChest compressions with or without rescue breathings are performed by an individual during \\ncardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in an attempt to restore spontaneous circulation.  \\nFor untrained or minimally trained first aid providers treating an adult victim, compression -only \\nCPR is recommended.  These chest compressions ensure a small but crucial supply of blood to \\nthe heart and brain.  \\nFor formally trained first aid providers (and professionals) treating an adult victim, compression \\nwith breaths is recommended. If the trained first aid provider is unable or unwilling, or in any \\nother circumstance, compression-only CPR may be substituted for compression with breaths. \\nFor babies and children under one year, compressions with breaths are always recommended. \\nB.5.1 WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE ? \\nIn case of a cardiac arrest (heart stops functioning) you might notice the following signs: \\n\\uf0a7 sudden collapse, \\n\\uf0a7 loss of consciousness, \\n\\uf0a7 no breathing, \\n\\uf0a7 no pulse (however, this is not always easy for laypeople to confirm). \\nB.5.1.1 HOW TO OBSERVE RESPONSIVENESS AND CONSCIOUSNESS? \\nUnconsciousness occurs when a person is suddenly unable to respond to stimuli like sound or \\npain, and appears to be asleep. A person may be unconscious for a few seconds (as is the \\ncase with fainting) or for longer periods of time.   \\nPeople who become unco nscious do not respond to loud sounds or shaking. They may even \\nstop breathing or their pulse may become faint. This calls for immediate emergency attention. \\nThe sooner the person receives emergency first aid, the better it is. \\nThe AVPU scale (an acronym from \"alert, voice, pain, unresponsiveness\") is a system by which \\na first aider can measure and record a person\\'s responsiveness, indicating the level of \\nconsciousness. It is based on the casualty’s eye opening, verbal and movement (motor) \\nresponses.  \\nThe AVPU scale has only four possible outcomes: \\n\\uf0a7 A – Alert.  \\nThe person is fully awake (although not necessarily oriented). The person will spontaneously \\nopen eyes, will respond to voice (although may be confused) and will have bodily motor \\nfunction.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\FA-manual-1.pdf'}, page_content=\"28 \\n\\uf0a7 V – Responding to voice. \\nThe person makes some kind of response when you talk to him. It could be opening his \\neyes, responding to your questions or initiating a move. These responses could be as little \\nas a grunt, moan, or slight movement of a limb when prompted by the voice of the rescuer. \\n\\uf0a7 P – Responding to pain. \\nThe person makes a response of any kind  on the application of pain stimulus , such as a \\ncentral pain stimulus like a  rub on his breastbone or a peripheral stimulus such as squeezing \\nhis fingers.  \\nPersons with some level of consciousness (a fully conscious person would not require any \\npain stimuli) may respond by using their voice, moving their eyes, or moving part of their \\nbody (including abnormal posturing). \\n\\uf0a7 U - Unresponsiveness also noted as 'Unconsciousness'. \\n \\nThis outcome is recorded if the person does not give any eye, voice or motor response to \\nvoice or pain. \\nTo check a person’s responsiveness/consciousness state check the following: \\n1. A person who looks around, speaks, responds clearly to questions, feels touch and \\nmoves or walks around, is considered alert (A). \\n2. The person opens his eyes and responds to simple questions: \\n\\uf0a7 “What is your name?” \\n\\uf0a7 “Where do you live?” \\n\\uf0a7 “How old are you?” \\nThe person responds to simple commands: \\n\\uf0a7 “Squeeze my hand.” \\n\\uf0a7 “Move your arm/leg/foot/hand.” \\nIf the person responds, he is responsive to voice (V). \\n3. If there is still no response, pinch the person and see if he opens his eyes or moves. \\n  If the person responds to pain, he is responsive to pain (P). \\nIf the person does not react to any of these stimuli, he is in an unconscious state (U).  \\nNote that a person might only  partially respond to the stimuli you provide (sound, touch, \\npain) and might be in an in-between (groggy) state.\"),\n",

Reasons for \\nblockage may be: \\n\\uf0a7 Loss of muscular control in the throat may allow the tongue to sag back and block \\nthe air passage. \\n\\uf0a7 When the reflexes are impaired, saliva  may lie in the back of the throat, blocking \\nthe airway. \\n\\uf0a7 Any foreign body in the throat may block the air passage e.g. vomit, blood, \\ndentures etc.  \\nIt is essential to establish a clear airway immediately. Unless you can clearly see that \\nthe person is breathing normally, an unconscious person must be turned onto his back \\nto unblock the breathing passage and to check for breathing. Unblocking the \\nbreathing passage takes priority over concerns about a potential spinal injury.  \\nTo observe the breathing do following: \\n1. If the person is unconscious and is not on his back, turn him on to his back.  \\n2. Kneel beside the casualty. \\n \\n3. Lift the chin forwards with the index and middle fingers of one hand while pressing \\nthe forehead backwards with the palm of the other hand. This manoeuvre will lift \\nthe tongue forward and clear the airways. \\n \\n4.

It can appear as if the person is barely breathing or is taking infrequent \\nnoisy gasps. It is important not to confuse this with normal breathing and you should \\nstart resuscitation immediately. \\n \\n5. If the casualty’s chest still fails to rise, first assume tha t the airway is not fully open. \\nOnce the airway is cleared the casualty may begin breathing spontaneously.  \\nClear the airway by removing any visible item that is blocking the airway:  \\na. Hook your first two fingers covered with clean cloth/gloves. \\nb. Sweep round inside the mouth/throat.  \\nc. Check again the breathing. \\nOne should not spend time searching for hidden obstructions.  \\nCare should be taken not to push any object further down the throat. \\n \\nBe careful: do not put your fingers in somebody’s closed mouth. \\nMore information on the breathing can be found in the respective chapter page 52.\"),\n",

Every time we breathe in, air containing oxygen enters the lungs. \\nWhen we breathe out  air containing waste products is removed from the lungs. In each \\ninspiration we take approximately 500 cc of air in.  \\nRespiration is defined as the transport of oxygen from the outside air to the cells within the body \\ntissues, and the transport of carbon dioxide (a waste product) in the opposite direction.  \\nC.1.1 THE RESPIRATORY SYSTE M \\n \\nC.1.1.1 THE AIR PASSAGES \\nThe air passages  consist of the nose, throat (pharynx), wind pipe (trachea) and air -tubes \\n(bronchi). The bronchi divide into min ute branches (bronchioles) which end in the lung \\nsubstance (alveoli). \\nC.1.1.2 THE LUNGS \\nThe lungs (two in number) are situated on the right and left sides of the chest cavity.

The ribs \\nmove upwards and forwards increasing the capacity of the chest cavity from front to back by \\nthe action of the muscles situated between the ribs; the lungs thus expand and air enters them. \\nThis is an active process. \\nDuring expiration (breathing out) the reverse process takes place. The diaphragm comes back \\nto its original state and the ribs fall back thus forcing the air out of the lungs. This is a passive \\nprocess. \\nSmall blood vessels (capillaries) surround the alveoli.  The exchanges of oxygen and carbon \\ndioxide take place through the blood circulating in these capillar ies. Oxygen is absorbed by \\nthe red blood corpuscles of the blood; water vapour and carbon dioxide are let out from the \\nblood plasma into the alveoli and expelled out. \\nThe lungs are also supplied with nerves which are connected to an area in the brain calle d \\nrespiratory centre.

It acts as a pump. It is \\ndivided into four chambers. The right upper chamber  called the right atrium receives impure \\nblood from all parts of the body through blood vessels called veins.  \\n \\n   \\nWhen the heart muscle contract s (the heart beats) this impure blood is passed into the right \\nlower chamber, called right ventricle, and finally finds its way to the lungs where it is purified. \\nDuring the process of purification, it gives up carbon -dioxide and takes a fresh quantity of \\noxygen.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\FA-manual-1.pdf'}, page_content='77 \\nThe purified blood finds its way into the left upper chamber called left atrium. It then passes to \\nthe left lower chamber, called left ventricle, and from there, in the course of the beating of the \\nheart the purified blood is discharged into various blood vessels called arteries and capillaries \\nwhich convey this purified blood for the nourishment for the body as a whole  including the \\nheart muscles. Thus each heart is in fact two pumps put together. \\nD.1.2 BLOOD PRESSURE  \\nThe pressure in the arteries varies with the beating of the heart. When the heart contracts the \\npressure in the arterial system increases; when the heart relaxes, the pressure in the arter ies \\ndecreases. The pressure exerted on the main arteries is known as the blood pressure and is \\nrecorded by a blood pressure measuring instrument. \\nD.1.3 PULSE \\nWith each heartbeat blood is ejected into the arterial system. Most of the arteries are placed \\ndeep in the body except on the wrist, elbow, neck, groin and ankle. So arterial pulse is normally \\nfelt over the lateral side of the wrist, in the neck, temples, and groin and near the ankle. You \\nmay not be able to feel arteries even at these sites (except carotid a rtery in the neck which is \\na major artery near to the heart) when the person is in shock. Nevertheless, f eeling the pulse \\ncorrectly is not always easy and requires training.  \\nPulse rate in a normal resting adult is between 60 and 100 beats per minute.

Blood is one of them. It circulates in a \\nclosed system formed by the heart, the arteries, capillaries and the veins. An average adult \\nhas a volume of five to six litres blood which constantly circulat es.  \\nThe blood is a thick viscid liquid of bright red or scarlet colour when it flows from the heart to \\nthe arteries and takes a dark red or purple hue when it comes back to the heart via the veins. \\nIt has a saline taste.'),\n",

The \\nremainder yellowish liquid portion of the blood is called plasma which contains \\nproteins, enzymes and other important ingredients. \\n\\uf0a7 Whenever blood comes in contact with some external material it  tends to solidify, \\nforming a clot to stop further bleeding. When the blood clots inside the arteries, \\nveins or the heart it is referred to as a thrombus. \\nD.1.5 HOW BLOOD CLOTS  \\nWhen a blood vessel is severed or damaged, it constricts (narrows) in order to prevent \\nexcessive amounts of blood from escaping.  At a first stage, specialized blood cells called \\nplatelets come into contact with the damaged vessel wall, become sticky and s tart to clump \\nat the site of the injury. \\nInjured tissue cells at the site of the wound together with the clumped platelets, trigger a series \\nof complex chemical reactions that result in the formation of a substance called fibrin. Strands \\n(filaments) of fib rin come together to form a mesh, which traps blood cells to make a blood \\nclot.

This is very serious and can indicate that the person may suffer from a heart attack. \\nA heart attack happens when there is a blockage of the blood flow to some parts of the \\nheart muscle. In that case, a part of the heart muscle starts to die as soon as that region does \\nnot get any blood supply.

When a blood vessel is \\ndamaged, several mechanisms are activated to control blood loss: the vessel constricts, and \\na series of chemical reactions occur to form a blood clot as a “plug” over the damaged area. \\nIf blood vessels are torn or severed, uncontrolled blood loss may occur before clotting can take \\nplace, and shock may develop. \\nD.3.1 TYPES OF BLEEDING  \\nA bleeding can be classified by the type of the blood vessel that has been damaged: \\n\\uf0a7 Arterial bleeding. \\n \\nArteries carry bright red oxygen rich blood under pressure from the heart. If an artery is \\ndamaged, the bleeding may be profuse. The blood will spurt out of it in time with the \\nheartbeat. If a main artery is severed, the blood may jet several feet high. In this case, the \\nvolume of the circulating blood will fall rapidly.  \\n\\uf0a7 Venous bleeding. \\n \\nThe blood in the veins, having given up its oxygen into the tissues, is dark red.

These wounds appear often when experiencing a sliding fall \\n(e.g. of a bike). The wounds often contain embedded foreign particles which may result \\nin infections. Abrasions do not bleed much, but are usually very painful. \\n\\uf0a7 Incisions \\n \\nIncised wounds  are caused by sharp instruments such as a knife, razor, etc. The blood \\nvessels show a straight cut and bleeding may be profuse. Other structures such as tendons \\nand nerves may be damaged too. \\n\\uf0a7 Contusions (bruises) \\n \\nContused wounds  are caused by blows , by blunt instruments or by punching. The \\ncapillaries are ruptured by the punch and blood leaks into the tissues. Severe contusion \\nmight be an indication of a deeper damage, like a fracture or internal injury.'),\n",

The edges are mostly irregular in shape. There is \\nusually more underlying tissue damage. These wounds are often contaminated with \\ngerms; the risk of infection is high.  This type of wound sometimes has less bleeding, but is \\nusually very painful. \\n\\uf0a7 Puncture wounds \\n \\nPuncture wounds  are caused by stabs or sharp instrument s like knifes, daggers or nails. \\nThese wounds typically have a smaller opening, but may reach deep into the tissue. These \\nmay not be very painful. \\n \\nA stab wound is a puncture wound by a knife or sharp blade.  \\nA gunshot wound is the wound caused by a bullet or missile driven into the body. The entry \\nwounds of gunshot wounds are mostly small and neat. If the projectile also exits the body, \\nthe exit wound may be large and ragged.'),\n",

Germs are \\nbacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. \\nAn infection i s caused by germs getting into the body through the broken skin. The germs \\nmultiply in the wound and make it ‘infected’, also called as ‘ septic’. Germs may later get into \\nthe bloodstream and cause a septicaemia. \\nA wound is initially not infected, even though it may be contaminated by dirt or mat erials that \\ncontain germs. An infection occurs after a lapse of time when the germs have time to multiply \\nand invade the tissues. This time varies with the number of germs and their virulence and the \\nbody’s resistance to fight back.

If the blood loss exceeds 1.2 litres \\n(this is about one -fifth of the normal blood volume of an adult), shock may occur. The \\nblood loss may occur due to external and/or internal bleedings.  \\nLoss of other body fluids can also result in shock. Conditions that cause heavy fluid losses \\ninclude diarrhoea, severe burns, etc.  \\n\\uf0a7 Cardiogenic shock \\nIn addition, shock may occur when an adequate volume of blood is available, but the \\nheart is unable to pump the blood around.  This problem can be due to severe heart \\ndiseases, heart attack or acute heart failure. \\n\\uf0a7 Other types of shock \\nOther causes of shock include overwhelming infections ( septic shock) , lack of certain \\nhormones, low blood sugar level ( hypoglycaemia) ( metabolic sh ock), under-cooling \\n(hypothermia), injuries to the respiratory track or lungs ( respiratory shock), severe allergic \\nreactions (anaphylactic shock), drug overdose or spinal cord injuries (neurogenic shock). \\nD.13.2 WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE ? \\nYou might observe following symptoms: \\n\\uf0a7 Initially: \\n\\uf0a7 rapid pulse; \\n\\uf0a7 pale looks; \\n\\uf0a7 cold clammy, sweaty skin. \\n\\uf0a7 As shock develops: \\n\\uf0a7 rapid, shallow breathing; \\n\\uf0a7 cold, clammy skin; \\n\\uf0a7 rapid, weak pulse; \\n\\uf0a7 dizziness or fainting; \\n\\uf0a7 weakness; \\n\\uf0a7 eyes appear to stare; \\n\\uf0a7 anxiety or agitation;'),\n",

Always assume a fracture and not a simple bruising in these cases. Deal it as a case of \\nfracture of pelvis. \\nFractures of the thigh bone are a serious injury. There will be bleeding into the surrounding tissues \\nand this might result in shock. The healing of the bone takes long time and is even more \\nprolonged in older people.  \\nFractures of the lower leg include fractures of the shin bone (tibia) and the splint bone (fibula). \\nShin bone fractures are mostly the result of a heavy blow. The splint bone and ankle fractures \\ncan result because of twisting of   ankle.'),\n",

It is here that \\nsensations are analysed and orders are given to the muscles.  \\nThe brain is encased in the skull and suspended in a clear fluid, called the cerebrospinal fluid \\n(CSF), which acts as a partial shock absorber. Nonetheless, since the brain is free to move within \\nthe skull the brain is sensitive to violent movements or pressure.  \\nThe brain has three main structures: \\n\\uf0a7 the cerebrum , which is concerned with thought, sensation, and conscious \\nmovement;      \\n\\uf0a7 the cerebellum, which coordinates movement, balance, and posture; and  \\n\\uf0a7 the brain stem, which controls basic functions such as breathing.'),\n",

The cord runs through the spinal column. \\nThe main function of the spinal cord is to convey signals between the brain and the peripheral \\nnervous system. \\nF.1.2 THE PERIPHERAL NERVOU S SYSTEM (PNS) \\nThe peripheral nerves emerge in pairs, each containing motor and sensory nerves, from the \\nbrain and spinal cord. Sensory nerves transmit impressions received by the senses (sight, \\nhearing, touch etc.) to the brain and motor nerves then transmit the ‘orders’ given by the brain \\nto the voluntary muscles. When a nerve is cut there is a loss of feeling, power and movement \\nin that part of the body which is controlled by that nerve. \\nThe peripheral nervous system can be divided in voluntary or somatic nervous system and an \\nautonomic nervous system.  \\nF.1.2.1 THE SOMATIC NERVOUS SYSTEM \\nThe somatic system is the part of the  peripheral nervous system that is responsible for carrying \\nmotor and sensory information both to and from the central nervous system. This system is made \\nup of nerves that connect to the skin, sensory organs and all skeletal muscles. The system is \\nresponsible for nearly all voluntary muscle movements as well as for pro cessing sensory \\ninformation that arrives via external stimuli including hearing, touch and sight.  \\nF.1.2.2 THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM \\nThe autonomic nervous system is the part of the peripheral nervous system that regulates key \\ninvoluntary functions of the body. This system is not controlled by the will and acts continuously \\nwhether a person is awake or asleep. It controls different body functions  including the activity \\nof the heart muscle; the smooth muscles, including the muscles of the intestinal tract; and the \\nglands. The autonomic nervous system has two divisions: the sympathetic nervous system, \\nwhich accelerates the heart rate, constricts blood vessels, and raises blood pressure, and \\nthe parasympathetic nervous system, which slows the heart rate, increases intestinal and gland \\nactivity, and relaxes sphincter muscles.'),\n",

A person has perhaps lost \\nconsciousness if he does not react to your action by opening his eyes or answering your \\nquestions.  \\nThere is no absolute dividing line between consciousness and un- consciousness. People \\ncan be fully conscious (aware and awake) or fully unconscious (no reaction to any stimulus) \\nor at any level between these two extremes. \\nLoss of consciousness causes the muscles to relax.  During the period of \\nunconsciousness the tongue might fall backwards and block the breathing passage. \\nIn fainting, the unconscious state is usually brief as in vasovagal syncope.  Fainting can occur \\ndue to various reasons such as emotional distress, tiredness, hunger, standing up for long \\nperiod, a sudden change in body position, being a long time in a hot environment, or \\nspecific medical conditions. Pregnant women, children and the elderly can be more \\nvulnerable to these causes. \\nLonger periods of unconsciousness are more serious. Causes include head injuries, cardiac \\narrest, stroke or poisoning. \\nIn an unconscious state, the person will be unresponsive to your activities (touching, sounds \\nor other stimulation). \\nCheck the following: \\n\\uf0a7 Whether the person opens his eyes and responds to simple questions: \\n\\uf0a7 “What is your name?” \\n\\uf0a7 “Where do you live?” \\n\\uf0a7 “How old are you?” \\n\\uf0a7 Whether the person responds to simple commands: \\n\\uf0a7 “Squeeze my hand.” \\n\\uf0a7 “Move your arm/leg/foot/hand.” \\n\\uf0a7 If there is no response, pinch the person and see if he opens his eyes or moves. \\nIf the person does not react to any of these stimuli, he is in an unconscious state.  \\nNote that a person might only  partially respond to the stimuli  you provide (sound, \\ntouch, pain); he might be in an in-between state. \\nWhen the person becomes conscious again after a period of unconsciousness, he might \\nsuffer from: \\n\\uf0a7 confusion, \\n\\uf0a7 drowsiness, \\n\\uf0a7 light-headedness, \\n\\uf0a7 headache, \\n\\uf0a7 loss of bowel and bladder control (incontinence),'),\n",

It can be caused by a blow on the \\nhead or a fall. There is a brief period of impaired consciousness following the blow to the head.  \\nThe casualty might complain of dizziness, headache, blurred vision or nausea. Typically there is \\na brief loss of memory of any events that occurred at the time of, or immediately preceding, \\nthe injury. \\nF.3.2 CEREBRAL COMPRESSION  \\nSome head injuries may produce a compression of brain tissue.

Peristalsis also is at work in this \\norgan, moving food through and mixing it with digestive secretions from the pancreas and \\nliver. The duodenum is largely responsible for the continuous breaking -down process, with \\nthe jejunum and ileum mainly responsible for absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream.  \\nContents of the small intestine start out semi-solid, digested on the way and end in a more \\nliquid form after passing through the organ. Water, bile, enzymes, and mucous contribute \\nto the change in consistency. Once the nutrients have been absorbed and the leftover -\\nfood residue liquid has  passed through the small intestine, it then moves on to the large \\nintestine, or colon. \\n\\uf0a7 Pancreas \\nThe pancreas secretes digestive enzymes into the duodenum, the first segment of the small \\nintestine.

The appendix is a small tube attached \\nto the cecum. The large intestine is a highly specialized organ that is responsible for \\nprocessing waste so that emptying the bowels is easy and convenient. \\nStool, or waste left over from the digestive process, is passed through the colon by means \\nof peristalsis, first in a liquid state and ultimately in a semi-solid/solid form. As stool pass es \\nthrough the colon, water is removed. Stool is stored in the sigmoid (S-shaped) colon until a \\n\"mass movement\" empties it into the rectum once or twice a day. It normally takes about \\n36 hours for stool to get through the colon. The stool itself is mostly food debris and bacteria. \\nThese bacteria perform several useful functions, such as synthesizing various vitamins, \\nprocessing waste products and food particles, and protecting against harmful bacteria. \\nWhen the descending colon becomes full of stool, also c alled faeces, it empties its \\ncontents into the rectum to begin the process of elimination. \\n\\uf0a7 Rectum \\nThe rectum is 18 to 20 cm (app. 8-inch) chamber that connects the colon to the anus. It is \\nthe rectum\\'s job to receive stool from the colon, to let the person  know that there is stool \\nto be evacuated, and to hold the stool until evacuation happens. When anything (gas or \\nstool) comes into the rectum, sensors send a message to the brain. The brain then decides \\nif the rectal contents can be released or not.

This condition is sometimes referred to as ‘ pre-diabetes’. If the \\nblood sugar level is above the normal range, the risk of developing ‘full -blown’ diabetes is \\nincreased.  \\nThere are two main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. \\nG.4.1 TYPE 1 DIABETES \\nIn type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce \\ninsulin. As no insulin is produced, the glucose level increase s, which can seriously damage the \\nbody's organs. People diagnosed with type 1 diabetes need insulin injections for the rest of their \\nlife. \\nType 1 diabetes is often known  as insulin-dependent diabetes . It's also sometimes  known \\nas juvenile diabetes or early-onset diabetes when it develops in young persons , often during \\nthe teenage years.  \\nType 1 diabetes is less common than type 2 diabetes.  \\nG.4.2 TYPE 2 DIABETES \\nType 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn't produce enough insulin, or the body's cells don't \\nrespond to insulin. This is known as insulin resistance. \\nType 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1 diabetes.  \\nPeople diagnosed with type 2 diabetes may be able to control the symptoms simply by eating \\na healthy diet, exercising regularly, and monitoring their blood glucose levels frequently. \\nHowever, as type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes \\nmay eventually need medication, usually in the form of tablets and/or injections. \\nType 2 diabetes is often associated with  obesity. It is sometimes referred to as maturity-onset \\ndiabetes because it's more common in older people. \\nG.4.3 GESTATIONAL DIABETES (DIABETES DURING PREGNANCY) \\nDuring pregnancy, some women have such high levels of blood glucose that their body is \\nunable to  produce enough insulin to convert it into energy . This is known as gestational \\ndiabetes. \\nPregnancy can also make existing type 1 diabetes worse. Ges tational diabetes can increase \\nthe risk of health problems developing in an unborn baby, so it's important to keep the \\nblood glucose levels under control. \\nIn most cases, gestational diabetes develops during the second trimester of pregnancy (weeks \\n14 to 26) and usually disappears after the baby is born. However, women who have gestational \\ndiabetes are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.\"),\n",

Keratinocytes produce the protein known as keratin, the main component of the \\nepidermis. Melanocytes produce the skin pigment, known as melanin. Langerhans cells \\nprevent things from getting into the skin. \\nH.1.2 THE MIDDLE LAYER : DERMIS \\nThe dermis is a complex combination of blood vessels, hair follicles, and sebaceous (oil) glands. \\nHere, you’ll find collagen and elastin, two proteins offering the  skin’s support and elasticity. \\nFibroblasts are the cells that synthesize collagen and elastin.  \\nThis layer also contains pain and touch receptors.  \\nIt is this layer that is responsible for wrinkles. \\nH.1.3 THE FATTY LAYER : HYPODERMIS  \\nThis layer is also known as the subcutis.  \\nIt hosts sweat glands, and fat and collagen cells, and is responsible for conserving your body’s \\nheat and protecting your vital inner organs.'),\n",

A section of the brain called the hypothalamus controls the b ody’s \\nthermoregulation. It issues instructions to muscles, organs, glands, and nervous system when it \\nsenses the core internal temperature is becoming too low or too high.  \\nOne of the major functions of the skin is to help to maintain the body temperature.  \\nH.2.3.1 HOW THE SKIN HELPS TO KEEP THE BODY WARM? \\nWhen the body becomes too cold, blood vessels at the body’s skin surface narrow ( constrict) \\nto keep the warm blood in the core of the body. The activity of the sweat glands in the skin is \\nreduced and the hairs sta nd on end to keep warm air close to the skin. Shivering is a method \\nto generate heat by involuntary muscle activity. \\nH.2.3.2 HOW THE SKIN HELPS TO KEEP THE BODY COLD? \\nWhen the body becomes too hot, blood vessels at the body’s skin surface widen ( dilate) to \\nloose heat by the increased blood flow. The activity of the sweat glands in the skin is turned up \\nto create more sweat, which cools down the skin as it evaporates.  \\nH.2.4 IMMUNITY \\nSeveral types of skin cells (e.g. Langerhans cells, phagocytic cells, epidermal dendritic cells) \\nare responsible for the destruction of microorganisms or are involved in the interaction of the \\nskin with the body's immune system. \\nH.2.5 ALLOWS GROWTH AND MOV EMENT \\nThe elasticity of the skin allows growth, movement and adaptation of the contours of the body \\nduring movement. \\nH.2.6 EXCRETION \\nThe body releases waste products  from the body via the surface of the skin, regulated by the \\nvolume and composition of sweat (e.g. excretion of water, urea, ammonia and uric acid). \\nH.2.7 SYNTHESIS OF VITAMINS  \\nThe skin plays an important role in the synthesis of vitamin D.\"),\n",

However, any burn injury can lead to \\ncomplications. \\nThe danger from burns usually depends more on the area of the burns rather than the degree. \\nSuperficial burns over a large area of the body are more dangerous than the complete \\ncharring of a part of the limb. It must be noted that a burn is mostly a mixture itself of different \\ndegrees of burns, and that in the same person different degrees of burns may show on different \\nparts of the body.  \\nThe most important dangers are: \\n\\uf0a7 Infection \\nBurn injuries leave the skin open and susceptible to infection. Burn injuries also increase \\nyour risk of sepsis, w hich is a life- threatening infection  that rapidly travels through the \\nbloodstream. Sepsis can cause shock and organ failure. \\n\\uf0a7 Low blood volume \\nBurn injuries damage the skin and the blood vessels, causing fluids to escape the body. \\nThis can result in low blood volume, known as hypovolemia. A severe loss of fluid and blood \\ncan prevent the heart from pumping enough blood through the body (resulting in shock). \\n\\uf0a7 Low body temperature \\nThe skin helps to control the body's temperature. When a large portion of the skin is injured, \\nthe body loses heat. This increases the risk of hypothermia — i.e. when the body loses heat \\nfaster than it can produce – resulting in a dangerously low body temperature. \\n\\uf0a7 Breathing difficulties \\nOne of the most common dangers that accompany burn injuries is the inhalation of smoke \\nor hot air. This can burn the airways, making it difficult to breathe. Smoke can permanently \\ndamage the lungs and lead to respiratory failure. \\n\\uf0a7 Pain \\nBurn wounds are very painful.  \\n\\uf0a7 Disability \\nBurn injuries form scar tissue once healed. When the skin is burned,  the surrounding skin \\nstarts to pull together resulting in a post-burn contracture that prevents movement. Deeper \\nburns can limit movement of the bones or joints when skin, muscles or tendons shorten and \\ntighten, permanently pulling joints out of position.\"),\n",

It is caused by the exposure to ultraviolet rays from \\nthe sun. When UV B rays penetrate the deeper skin layers damage to the cells occu rs. The skin \\nbecomes red and painful. In some cases the damage to the cells is so severe resulting in skin \\npeeling and blistering. \\nStrong or cool wind , or a body covered by water or sweat , might give the sunbathing person \\na falsely reassuring effect  of not being sunburned. As c louds have less  limiting effect on UV \\nradiation than they do on temperature, sunburns still can happen on cloudy days . White \\nsurfaces such as snow or sand reflect UV radiation and so increase the risk of sunburn. Rippling \\nwater and rough sea reflect more UV radiation than calm open water.  Sunlight has a shorter \\ndistance to travel in order to reach the earth’s surface in areas closer to the tropics; UV \\nradiation levels will therefore , be higher in these areas because there is less dissi pation of the \\nrays as they travel to earth. The level of UV radiation also increases with altitude as the \\natmosphere becomes thinner and there is less absorption of the radiation.  \\nH.3.9.1.1 WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE? \\nFollowing signs and symptoms may be observed when a person suffers a sunburn: \\n\\uf0a7 reddened skin, \\n\\uf0a7 warm skin, and \\n\\uf0a7 pain of varying degrees.  \\nIn more severe cases: \\n\\uf0a7 swelling,  \\n\\uf0a7 blistering, and  \\n\\uf0a7 weeping skin. \\nH.3.9.1.2 WHAT DO I DO? \\n \\n1.

A \\nfrostbite is damage to skin and tissues caused by exposure to freezing temperatures – typically \\nany temperature below minus 0.5 degrees Celsius (31 degrees Fahrenheit).  \\nCauses can be exposure to extreme cold weather , wearing inadequate or wet clothing, or \\nwind chill. The p oor blood circulation caused by too tight clothing or boots, staying in a \\ncramped position, fatigue, certain medications,  smoking, alcohol use, or diseases that affect \\nthe blood vessels, such as diabetes may enhance the process.  \\nFrostbites can affect any part of your body. However, the extremities, such as the hands, feet, \\nears, nose and lips,  are most likely to be affected  as the body is constricting circulation to \\nextremities on its own to preserve core temperature and fight hypothermia. \\nThe symptoms of frostbite usually begin with the affected parts feeling cold and painful. If \\nexposure to  the cold continues, the person may feel pins and needles before the area \\nbecomes numb as the tissues freeze. \\nPeople with a history of severe frostbite often report after effects of frostbite.

Avoid wearing \\nloose clothing when cooking or handling a fire. Do not hang clothes near an open \\nfire. \\n\\uf0a7 Do not keep flammable objects like towels, potholders near to the fire.  \\n\\uf0a7 Do not overheat oil when cooking. \\n\\uf0a7 Never use water to extinguish burning oil  \\n\\uf0a7 Be careful when handling kerosene stoves and l amps as they can easily be \\nknocked over and ignite.  \\n\\uf0a7 Have something handy to extinguish a fire (wet towel or cloth, water, sand bucket, \\nfire extinguisher).'),\n",

Fever caused by \\nmalaria, typhoid, pneumonia (lung infection) etc., can be very dangerous if they are left \\nuntreated and can lead to death.  \\nThe normal body temperature is around 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit).  Fever \\nis generally agreed to be present if the temperature is above 37.7 degrees Celsius (100 \\ndegrees Fahrenheit). \\nFollowing set points are used to identify fever: \\n\\uf0a7 If the temperature in the anus (anal/rectal) is at or over 38.0 degrees Celsius (100.4 \\ndegrees Fahrenheit). \\n\\uf0a7 If the temperature in the mouth (oral) is at or over 37.7 degrees Celsius (100 degrees \\nFahrenheit). \\n\\uf0a7 If the temperature under the arm (axillary) or in the ear (otic) is at or over 37.2 degrees \\nCelsius (99.0 degrees Fahrenheit). \\nH.8.1 HOW TO MEASURE THE BODY TEM PERATURE? \\nThe body’s temperature can be measured by a thermometer you place in the armpit, \\nmouth, rectum, ear or on the forehead.   \\nH.8.1.1 TYPES OF THERMOMETERS \\nH.8.1.1.1  MERCURY TEMPERATURE THERMOME TERS \\n \\nIn a mercury thermometer, a glass tube is filled with mercury and a standard temperature \\nscale is marked on the tube. A mercury thermometer can be easily identified by the \\npresence of a silver bulb. Do not use mercury thermometers to measure the body \\ntemperature via the mouth or rectum. \\nIf the bulb is red, blue, purple, green or any other colour, it is not a mercury thermometer , \\nbut contains another non -poisonous fluid. It works on the same principle as a mercury \\nthermometer. These type of glass thermometer s also can be used to measure the body \\ntemperature via the mouth or rectum. \\nShake down the fluid in the glass thermometer before starting a new temperature \\nmeasurement. Do this by holding the thermometer firmly and flicking the wrist until the fluid \\nreads at or below the lowest number.  \\nWith changes in temperature, the fluid expands and contracts in a consistent fashion and \\nthe temperature can be read from the scale.'),\n",

After the body has taken the \\nfood components that it needs, waste products are left behind in the bowel and in the blood. \\nThe kidney and urinary systems help the body to eliminate liquid waste called urea, and to \\nkeep chemicals, such as potassium and sodium, and water in balance. Urea is produced when \\nfoods containing protein, such as meat, poultry, and certain vegetables, are broken down in \\nthe body. Urea is carried in the bloodstream to the kidneys, where it is removed along with \\nwater and other wastes in the form of urine. \\nOther important functions of the kidneys include blood pressure regulation and the production \\nof erythropoietin, which controls red blood cell production in the bone marrow. Kidneys also \\nregulate the acid-base balance and conserve fluids. \\n \\nA pair of purplish-brown organs, the kidneys, are located below the ribs toward the middle of \\nthe back. The functions of the kidneys are to: \\n\\uf0a7 Remove waste products and drugs from the body. \\n\\uf0a7 Balance the body's fluids. \\n\\uf0a7 Release hormones to regulate blood pressure. \\n\\uf0a7 Control production of red blood cells. \\nThe kidneys remove urea from the blood through tiny filtering units called nephrons. Each \\nnephron consists of a ball formed of small blood capillaries, called a glomerulus, and a small \\ntube called a renal tubule. Urea, together with water and other waste s ubstances, forms the \\nurine as it passes through the nephrons and down the renal tubules of the kidney .\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\FA-manual-1.pdf'}, page_content=\"264 \\n \\nTwo narrow tubes  (one on each side) , called  ureters, carry urine from the kidneys to the \\nbladder. Muscles in the ureter walls continually tighten and relax forcing urine downward, away \\nfrom the kidneys. If urine backs up, or is allowed to stand still, an infection can develop. About \\nevery 10 to 15 seconds, small amounts of urine are emptied into the bladder from the ureters.  \\nThe bladder, a  triangle-shaped, hollow organ , is located in the lower abdomen. It is held in \\nplace by ligaments that are attached to other organs and the pelvic bones. The bladder's walls \\nrelax and expand to store urine, and contract and flatten to  empty urine through the urethra. \\nThe typical healthy adult bladder can store up about 500-600 ml (ca. two cups) of urine for two \\nto five hours. \\nTwo sphincter muscles ( circular muscles) help keep urine from leaking by closing tightly like a \\nrubber band around the opening of the bladder.  Nerves in the bladder alert a person when it \\nis time to urinate, or empty the bladder.  \\nThe urethra allows urine to pass outside the body. The brain signals the bladder muscles to \\ntighten, which squeezes urine out of the bladder. At the same time, the brain sig nals the \\nsphincter muscles to relax to let urine exit the bladder through the urethra.

The penis is made up of two parts, the \\nshaft and the glans. The glans is the tip of the penis, while the shaft is the main part of the penis \\nand contains the tube (urethra) that drains the bladder. All boys are born with a foreskin, or a \\ncovering over the tip of the penis. Some boys are circumcised, which means that this covering \\nof skin is removed. Other boys are not circumcised and may have skin that covers the ti p of \\nthe penis. \\nThe scrotum is a bag of skin which holds and helps to protect the testicles. The testicles (or \\ntestes) are the male sex glands and are part of the male reproductive system. They are located \\nin the scrotum. To make sperm the temperature of t he testicles needs to be cooler than the \\ninside of the body. This is why they are located in the scrotum outside body. The testes are also \\ninvolved in producing a hormone called testosterone. Testosterone is an important hormone \\nduring male development and maturation for developing muscles, deepening the voice, and \\ngrowing body hair.  \\nA long tube, the epididymis, is located near each testicle. The epididymis is a collection of \\nmicroscopic tubes in which the sperms are stored. The vas deferens is the tube wh ich moves \\nthe sperms from the testicles out of the scrotal sac to the urethra and connects these together. \\nSeminal vesicles, the sac-like glands, lie behind the bladder and release a fluid that forms part \\nof semen. \\nThe prostate gland is about the size of a  walnut, and surrounds the neck of the bladder and \\nurethra. The prostate gland secretes a slightly alkaline fluid that forms part of the seminal fluid, \\na fluid that carries sperms. During male climax (orgasm), the muscular glands of the prostate \\nhelp to propel the prostate fluid, in addition to sperms that were made in the testicles, into the \\nurethra. \\nThe urethra is the tube that allows urine to flow outside the body. It is also the channel for semen \\nto pass during ejaculation.'),\n",

This is \\nwhere a man’s penis enters the woman during sexual intercourse. The vaginal opening is visible \\nfrom the outside but it is protected by the labia  \\nThe labia majora are two folds of skin that extend from the front of the vaginal opening to the \\nback of it. The outer surfaces of the folds have darker -colored skin and thick hairs, while the \\ninner folds are smoother.  The labia majora join to form the cleft shape of the female genitals.  \\nThe clitoris is a crucial element for sexual arousal in most women. This small sexual organ at the \\njunction of the labia minora appears outside the folds of skin like a small pink button. During \\nsexual stimulation, the clitoris functions much like a man’s penis in that it becomes erect due to \\nthe signals from the brain. The clitoris is a very sensitive area when stimulated.  \\nBetween the labia majora are the labia minora, two folds of skin that also extend down from \\nthe clitoris and around the vaginal opening. These vary in size from woman to woman. They \\nare joined together by a small fold of skin known as the fourchette. \\nThe outer female genitals also include the urethra. Located between the vaginal opening and \\nthe frontal connection of the labia minora, the urethral opening is where a woman expels urine \\nfrom her body. \\nThe womb or uterus is located between the bladder and the rectum, in the pelvic area. The \\nuterus is connected to the fallopian tubes, the cervix, and (via the cervix) the vagina.   \\nIn menstruating females, the ovaries release eggs that travel via the fall opian tubes to the \\nuterus. If fertilized, the egg will bind to the wall of the uterus and the foetus will develop. The \\nuterus nourishes and protects the foetus until birth. \\nThe cervix of the uterus, also known as the cervix or uterine cervix, attaches the vagina to the \\nuterus. It is approximately four centimetres long. The uterine cervix produces a mucus that aids \\nin carrying sperm from the vagina to the uterus, where it can fertilize an egg if the woman is \\novulating. When the woman isn't ovulating, the cervical mucus thickens and serves as a barrier \\nto keep sperm out of the uterus. \\nDuring childbirth, the cervix thins out and eventually dilates (expands) to 10 centimetres to \\nallow the baby to pass through the birth canal. Once the baby is born and the placen ta is \\nexpelled, the cervix begins to thicken and close.\"),\n",

Females have a pair of ovaries, held by a ligament beside the uterus on each side \\nof the lower abdomen.   \\nDuring ovulation, a follicle (a small egg in the ovary ) expels an egg under the stimulation of \\ngonadotropic hormones . The rest of the follicle, or the corpus luteum, secretes the sex \\nhormones oestrogen and progesterone, which regulate menstruation and control the \\ndevelopment of the sex organs. The sex hormone s and the gonadotropic hormones interact \\nwith each other to control the menstrual cycle. \\nWhen an egg matures, it is released and passes into the fallopian tube toward the uterus. If the \\novum is fertilized by the male reproductive cell, or sperm, conception happens and pregnancy \\nbegins.'),\n",

Usually the most obvious sign is the \\nabsence of menstruation (amenorrhea). However, some women may continue to have some \\nbleeding even while pregnant. The following  are the most common initial signs of pregnancy. \\nHowever, each woman may experience the signs of pregnancy differently. These may include: \\n\\uf0a7 fatigue, \\n\\uf0a7 sore and swollen breasts, \\n\\uf0a7 nausea or vomiting (also called morning sickness), \\n\\uf0a7 frequent urination, \\n\\uf0a7 certain food cravings or aversions, \\n\\uf0a7 bloating of the abdomen, and \\n\\uf0a7 darkening of the skin around the breast nipples (also called the areola). \\nThese early signs may not always indicate pregnancy, but may signal another process \\noccurring within the body \\nA pregnancy is divided into three phases, called trimesters. Each trimester has its own significant \\nmilestones. The first trimester is the most fragile period, during which all major organs and \\nsystems are formed. Most birth defects and miscarriages occur during the first trimester. During \\nthe second and third trimesters, the foetus is fully formed and grows and matures rapidly. \\nAfter nine months of incredible growth and changes both in the mother and the foetus, labour \\n(contractions) may finally start, signalling the pendin g birth of the baby. Some  women may \\nfear the prospect of delivering their child. Part of this fear may be attributed to the unknown, \\nespecially in first pregnancy. \\nLabour is a series of continuous, progressive contractions of the uterus which help the cervix to \\nopen (dilate) and to thin (efface), allowing the foetus to move through the birth canal.  Signs \\nof labour vary from woman to woman, as each woman experiences labour differently.  \\nSome common signs of labour may include: \\n\\uf0a7 A small amount of mucus, sligh tly mixed with blood, may be expelled from the \\nvagina indicating a woman is in labour.  \\n \\n\\uf0a7 Contractions (uterine muscle spasms) occurring at intervals of less than ten minutes \\nare usually an indication that labour has begun. Contractions may become more \\nfrequent and severe as labour progresses.  \\n \\n\\uf0a7 Labour sometimes begins with amniotic fluid gushing or leaking from the vagina. \\nWomen who experience a rupture of the amniotic sac should go to the healthcare \\nfacility immediately. The majority of women go into labour within hours after the \\namniotic sac breaks. If labour still does not begin, it needs to be induced.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\FA-manual-1.pdf'}, page_content='269 \\nL.3.1 STAGES OF LABOUR AND GIVING BIRTH  \\nThere are three stages of labour: \\n1. The first stage, when the contractions make the cervix gradually open up (dilate). \\nThis is usually the longest stage. \\n2. The second stage of labour is when the cervix is fully open and birth is given. This is \\nthe part of labour where the baby moves through the vagina by the woman in \\nlabour pushing with the contractions. \\n3. The third stage of labour is after the birth, when the womb contracts and causes \\nthe placenta to come out through the vagina. \\nL.3.1.1 THE FIRST STAGE OF LABOUR – DILATION \\nThe cervix needs to open about ten cm for a baby to pass through. This is what\\'s called being \\n\"fully dilated\". Contractions at the start of labour help to soften the cervix so that it gradually \\nopens. \\nThe woman in labour should attempt to get comfortable and relaxed, and if possible try to \\nsleep. A warm bath or shower may help to relax.  \\nDuring the day, the woman in labour can keep upright and be gently active. This helps the \\nbaby move down into the pelvis and helps the cervix to dilate. \\nOnce labour is established, the cervix reaches an opening of more than three centimetres; the \\ntime to full dilation is usually between 6 and 12 hours. It is often quicker in subsequent \\npregnancies. The woman in labour wi ll be asked not to try to push until the cervix is fully open \\nand the baby’s head can be seen. To help to overcome the urge to push, breathing out slowly \\nand gently or, if the urge is too strong breathing in small puffs may help. Some women find this \\neasier lying on their side, or on their knees and elbows, to reduce the pressure of the baby’s \\nhead on the cervix. \\nL.3.1.2 THE SECOND STAGE OF LABOUR \\nThis is the \"pushing\" stage. It begins when the cervix is fully dilated and lasts until the birth of the \\nbaby.  When the cervix is fully dilated the woman in labour will be asked to push when she feels \\nthe need to do so during contractions.  \\nThis stage of labour is hard work. This stage may take 1-2 hour. \\nWHAT HAPPENS AT THE ACTUAL BIRTH? \\nDuring the second stage, the baby’s head moves down the vagina until it can be seen. When \\nthe head is almost ready to come out, the woman in labour will be asked to stop pushing and \\nto do a couple of quick short breaths, blowing out through the mouth. This  is done so that the \\nbaby’s head can be born slowly and gently, giving the skin and muscles of the perineum (the \\narea between the vagina and anus) time to stretch without tearing. The skin of the perineum \\nusually stretches well, but it may tear. Afterwards , the cut or tear may be stitched up to help \\nthe healing process.  \\nOnce baby’s head is born, most of the hard work is over. With one more gentle push, the body \\nis born quite quickly and easily. The baby may be born covered with a white, greasy substance \\nknown as vernix, which has acted as protection in the uterus.'),\n",

Babies start \\nsucking immediately. However, this sometimes occurs just for a short period of time – they may \\njust like to feel the nipple in their mouth.'),\n",

However, with proper medical \\ncare, most women can enjoy a healthy pregnancy, despite their medical challenges.  It is \\nimportant that the pregnant woman contacts her healthcare provider early.  \\nL.5.1 DIABETES \\nDiabetes in pregnancy can have serious consequences for the mother and the growing foetus. \\nThe severit y of problems often depends on the severity of the mother's diabetic disease, \\nespecially if she has vascular (blood vessel) complications and poor blood glucose control.   \\nGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the condition in which the glucose level is elevated and \\nother diabetic symptoms appear during pregnancy in a woman who has not previously been \\ndiagnosed with diabetes. In most cases of GDM, all diabetic symptoms disappear following \\ndelivery. However, women with gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing \\ndiabetes later in life, especially if they were overweight before pregnancy. Unlike other types \\nof diabetes, gestational diabetes is not caused by a lack of insulin, but by other hormones that \\nblock the insulin that is produced, a condition referred to as insulin resistance. \\nL.5.2 HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE  \\nHigh blood pressure can occur in pregnancy in two forms. It may be a pre -existing condition, \\ncalled chronic hypertension , or it can develop during pregnancy -- a condition known as \\ngestational hypertension. It is also called toxemia or preeclampsia/eclampsia and occurs most \\noften in young women with the first pregnancy. It is more common in twin pregnancies, and in \\nwomen who had blood pressure problems in a previous pregnancy.  \\nHigh blood pressure ca n lead to placental complications and slowed foetal growth. If \\nuntreated, severe hypertension may cause dangerous seizures and even death in the mother \\nand foetus.  \\nWomen who have high blood pressure before pregnancy often need to continue taking their \\nantihypertensive medication. Such patients need to be managed by joint physician and \\ngynaecologist care before conception and during pregnancy. Only the treating physician and \\nthe gynaecologist can give the correct advice on this. \\nL.5.3 INFECTIONS \\nInfections during  pregnancy can pose a threat to the foetus. Even a simple urinary tract \\ninfection or vaginal infection  which is common during pregnancy, should be treated \\nimmediately. An infection that goes untreated can lead to preterm labour and rupture of the \\nmembranes surrounding the foetus. \\nL.5.3.1 FOOD POISONING (E.G. LISTERIOSIS)  \\nA pregnant woman should avoid eating undercooked or raw foods because of the risk of food \\npoisoning. Food poisoning can dehydrate a mother and deprive the foetus of nourishment.  \\nL.5.3.2  CHLAMYDIA \\nChlamydia is a common sexually transmitted disease  (STD) that can infect both men and \\nwomen. It can cause serious, permanent damage to a woman's reproductive system, making \\nit difficult or impossible for her to get pregnant later on. Chlamydia infection is associated with \\ntubal disease and tubal pregnancy (pregnancy that occurs outside the womb) which can be \\nfatal.\"),\n",

New-borns can develop a chlamydia eye infection duri ng childbirth, which may \\nlead to blindness.  \\nThe only way to avoid STDs is to not to have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. If sexually active, the \\nfollowing things lower the chances of getting chlamydia: \\n\\uf0a7 Being in a long -term mutually monogamous relationship wit h a partner who has \\nbeen tested and has negative STD test results; \\n\\uf0a7 Using condoms the right way every time having sex. \\nL.5.3.3 HEPATITIS \\nHepatitis is an inflammation of the liver resulting in liver cell damage and destruction. Several \\ntypes of the hepatitis virus have been identified.  \\nThe most common type that occurs in pregnancy is hepatitis B (HBV). This type of hepatitis \\nspreads mainly through contaminated blood and blood products, sexual contact, and \\ncontaminated needles and syringes. Although HBV resolves in many people, some will develop \\nchronic HBV infection.  \\nHepatitis B virus can lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer, liver failure, and death. \\nInfected pregnant women can transmit the virus to the foetus during pregnancy and at \\ndelivery. The lat er in pregnancy a mother contracts the virus, the greater the chance for \\ninfection in her baby. A very safe and effective vaccine is available against HBV infection. \\nUsing safe blood and safe needles and syringes will also prevent viral hepatitis B.  \\n The only way to avoid sexual transmission is to not to have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. If sexually \\nactive, the following things lower the chances of getting HBV: \\n\\uf0a7 Being in a long -term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has \\nbeen tested and found negative for HBV; \\n\\uf0a7 Using latex condoms the right way every time having sex. \\nL.5.3.4 HIV AND AIDS \\nA woman with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has about one in four chance of infecting \\nher foetus. AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome ) is caused by the human  \\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV), which kills or impairs cells of the immune system and progressively \\ndestroys the body's ability to fight infections and certain cancers.  \\nHIV is spread most commonly by sexual contact with an infected partner. HIV may also be  \\nspread through contact with infected blood, especially by sharing needles, syringes, or drug \\nuse equipment with someone who is infected with the virus.  \\nSome people may develop a flu-like illness within a month or two after exposure to the HIV virus, \\nalthough many people do not develop any symptoms at all when they first become infected. \\nPersistent or severe symptoms may not surface for 10 years or more, after HIV first enters the \\nbody in adults, or within two years in children born with an HIV infection.  The term AIDS applies \\nto the most advanced stages of an HIV infection.  \\nUsing safe blood and safe needles and syringes will also prevent HIV/AIDS.

Genital \\nherpes can be spread to the baby during delivery, if a woman has an active infection at that \\ntime.  \\nHerpes infections can cause blisters and ulcers on the mouth or f ace (oral herpes), or in the \\ngenital area (genital herpes). HSV is a life-long infection. Symptoms of HSV may include painful \\nblisters or open sores in the genital area, which may be preceded by a tingling or burning \\nsensation in the legs, buttocks, or gen ital region. The herpes sores usually disappear within a \\nfew weeks, but the virus remains in the body and the lesions may recur from time to time.  \\nIt is important that women avoid contracting herpes during pregnancy, because a first episode \\nduring pregnancy creates a greater risk of transmission to the new -born. Genital herpes can \\ncause potentially fatal infections in babies if the mother has active genital herpes (shedding \\nthe virus) at the time of delivery. Fortunately, infection of an infant is rare amo ng women with \\ngenital herpes infection. Protection from genital herpes includes abstaining from sex when \\nsymptoms are present, and /or using latex condoms the right way every time having sex.  \\nL.5.3.6 CMV (CYTOMEGALOVIRUS) \\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) is one of the herpes  viruses.  CMV is spread by close contact with a \\nperson who has the virus in his or her saliva, urine, or other body fluids.  \\nCMV can be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her foetus during pregnancy. The virus in \\nthe mother’s blood crosses over the plac enta and infects the foetus’ blood. Most babies with \\ncongenital (meaning present at birth) CMV infection never have health problems. But in some \\nbabies, congenital CMV infection causes health problems that may be apparent at birth or \\nmay develop later during infancy or childhood. \\nA few simple steps can help to avoid exposure to saliva and urine that might contain CMV: \\n\\uf0a7 Washing the hands often with soap and water for 40-60 seconds, especially after \\n\\uf0a7 changing diapers, \\n\\uf0a7 feeding a young child, \\n\\uf0a7 wiping a young child’s nose or drool, or \\n\\uf0a7 handling children’s toys. \\n\\uf0a7 Do not share food, drinks, or eating utensils used by young children. \\n\\uf0a7 Avoid contact with saliva when kissing a child. \\n\\uf0a7 Clean toys, countertops, and other surfaces that come into contact with children’s \\nurine or saliva.'),\n",

Babies who became infected \\nbefore birth can be born with serious mental or physical problems. Toxoplasmosis often causes \\nflu-like symptoms, swollen lymph glands, or muscle aches and pains that last for a few days to \\nseveral weeks.  \\nThe following measures can help prevent toxoplasmosis infection: \\n\\uf0a7 Wear gloves when you garden or do anything outdoors that involves handling soil. \\nCats who may pass the parasite in their faeces, often use gardens. Avoid any \\ncontact with cat faeces. Wash your hands well with  soap and warm water after \\noutdoor activities, especially before you eat or prepare any food. \\n\\uf0a7 Have someone who is healthy and not pregnant handle raw meat for you. If this is \\nnot possible, wear clean gloves when you touch raw meat and wash any cutting \\nboards, sinks, knives, and other utensils that might have touched the raw meat. \\nWash your hands well with soap and warm water afterward. \\n\\uf0a7 Cook all meat thoroughly, that is, until it is no longer pink in the center or until the \\njuices run clear.

The bump is painful, soft and usually bursts and forms an ulcer within a \\nday of its appearance. Along with this bump (or ulcer), small rubbery bumps (but different from \\nthe former) may also be felt in the crease between the belly and thigh.  \\nPeople infected with this bacteria spread it to others through sexual contact.  \\nL.6.1.2 CHLAMYDIA \\nChlamydia is common and is easily passed on du ring sex. Most people don't experience any \\nsymptoms, so they are unaware they're infected. \\nIn women, chlamydia can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a vaginal \\ndischarge, pain in the lower abdomen during or after sex, and bleeding during or after sex or \\nbetween periods. It can also cause heavy periods. \\nIn men, chlamydia can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a white, cloudy or \\nwatery discharge from the tip of the penis, and pain or tenderness in the testicles.  \\nIt's also possible to have a chlamydia infection in the rectum (bottom), throat or eyes.  \\nYou can get chlamydia through unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex or by contact with \\npartner’s genitals, or sharing sex toys when they are not washed or covered with a new \\ncondom between each person who uses them. Sexual fluid from the penis or vagina can pass \\nchlamydia from one person to another even if the penis does not enter the vagina, anus or \\nmouth. This means you can get chlamydia from genital contact with someone who has the \\ninfection even if there is no penetration, orgasm or ejaculation. It isn’t clear if chlamydia could \\nbe passed on by transferring infected semen or vaginal fluid on the fingers, or by rubbing \\nfemale genitals together. Chlamydia cannot be passed on through ca sual contact, including \\nkissing and hugging, or from sharing baths, towels, swimming pools, toilet seats or cutlery.  \\nL.6.1.3 DONOVANOSIS \\nDonovanosis is a sexually transmissible genital ulcer disease. The bac terium that causes it is \\nKlebsiella granulomatis. It infects the skin around the genitals, groin or anal area and causes \\nulcers and destruction of the skin.  After infection, one or more initially painless ulcers (sores) or \\nlumps develop on the genitals, or around the anus or mouth.  \\nWithout treatment the ulcers will increase in size and can form a raised red fleshy lump that \\nprogressively destroys normal skin. Other bacteria can infect these sores, causing them to \\nbecome painful and distressing with an unpleasant smell. \\nDonovanosis is spread by sexual contact. Sy mptoms generally appear from 1 -4 weeks after \\ninfection but occasionally may take as long as a year to develop. A very small proportion of \\npeople may be infected through direct, nonsexual contact (skin-to-skin contact).\"),\n",

They're caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). The warts are usually \\npainless, but they may give some itching or redness. Occasionally, they can cause bleeding. \\nGenital warts can be spread during vaginal or anal sex, and by sharing sex toys. A person does \\nnot need to have penetrative sex to pass the infection on because HPV is spread by skin -to-\\nskin contact. \\nL.6.1.5 GENITAL HERPES \\nGenital herpes is a common infection caused by the herpes simplex virus  (HSV), which is the \\nsame virus that causes cold sores. \\nSome people develop symptoms of HSV a few days after coming into contact with the virus. \\nSmall, painful blisters or sores usually develop, wh ich may cause itching or tingling, or make it \\npainful to urinate. After a person is infected, the virus remains dormant (inactive) most of the \\ntime. However, certain triggers can reactivate the virus, causing the blisters to develop again, \\nalthough they're usually smaller and less painful. \\nGenital herpes is usually transmitted by having sex (vaginal, anal or oral) with an infected \\nperson. Even if someone with genital herpes doesn't have any symptoms, it's possible for them \\nto pass the infection to a sexual partner. \\nL.6.1.6 GONORRHOEA \\nGonorrhoea is a STI easily passed on during sex  caused by bacteria called Neisseria \\ngonorrhoeae or gonococcus. About 50% of women and 10% of men don't experience any \\nsymptoms and are unaware that they are infected. \\nIn women , gonorrhoea can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a vaginal \\ndischarge (often watery, yellow or green), pain in the lower abdomen during or after sex, and \\nbleeding during or after sex or between periods, sometimes causing heavy periods.  \\nIn men, gonorrhoea can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a white, yellow or \\ngreen discharge from the tip of the penis, and pain or tenderness in the testicles.  \\nIt's also possible to have a gonorrhoea infection in the rectum, throat or eyes.  \\nGonorrhoea is easily passed between people through unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex or \\nby sharing sex toys that haven't been washed or covered with a new condom each time they \\nare used. Gonorrhoea is not spread by kissing, hugging, sharing baths or towe ls, swimming \\npools, toilet seats, or sharing cups, plates and cutlery, because the bacteria can't survive \\noutside the human body for long. \\nL.6.1.7 HEPATITIS B  \\nHepatitis B is a type of virus that can infect the liver.  \\nSymptoms can include feeling sick, lack of ap petite, flu -like symptoms, such as tiredness, \\ngeneral aches and pains, and headaches, and yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice). \\nHowever, many people don't realise they have been infected with the virus because the \\nsymptoms may not develop immediately, or even at all.

It can also be transmitted by \\ncoming into contact with infected blood – for example, and sharing needles and syringes. \\nL.6.1.9 PUBIC LICE \\nPubic lice (\"crabs\" ( because they look similar to crabs. )) are easily passed to others through \\nclose genital contact. They\\'re usually found in pubic hair, but can live in underarm hair, body \\nhair, beards and occasionally eyebrows or eyelashes. \\nIt may take seve ral weeks for you to notice any symptoms. Most people experience itching, \\nand you may notice the lice or eggs on the hairs. Pubic lice are sometimes called crab lice \\nbecause they look similar to crabs. \\nPubic lice spread through close body contact with someone who has them. The lice crawl from \\nhair to hair, but cannot fly or jump. They need human blood to survive, so generally leave the \\nbody to move from one person to another. They are most commonly passed on during sexual \\ncontact. Condoms will not prevent them being passed to another person. It is also possible for \\npubic lice to be spread through sharing clothes, towels and bedding. \\nL.6.1.10 SCABIES \\nScabies is caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin. It can be passed on through close \\nbody or sexual contact, or from infected clothing, bedding or towels. \\nIf a person develops scabies, he may experience an intense itching that\\'s worse at night. The \\nitching can be in the genital area, but it also often occurs between the fingers, on wrists and \\nankles, under the arms, or on the body and breasts. \\nThe infected person may have a rash or tiny spots. In some people, scabies can be confused \\nwith eczema. It\\'s usually very difficult to see the mites. \\nScabies mites can be passed on through close body or sexual contact, or from infected \\nclothing, bedding or towels. \\nL.6.1.11 SYPHILIS \\nSyphilis is a bacterial infection (Treponema pallidum) that in the early stages causes a painless, \\nbut highly infectious, sore on the genitals or around the mouth. The sore can last up to six weeks \\nbefore disappearing.'),\n",

These \\nmay disappear within a few weeks, after which you'll have a symptom -free phase. \\nThe late or tertiary stage of syphilis usually occurs after many years, and can cause serious \\nconditions such as heart problems, paralysis and blindness. \\nThe syphilis bacteria can enter your body if you have close contact with an infected sore, \\nnormally during vaginal, anal or oral sex, or by sharing sex toys with someo ne who is infected. \\nIt may also be possible to catch syphilis by sharing needles for drug use with somebody who is \\ninfected. Pregnant women can pass the infection to their unborn baby. Syphilis also cannot be \\nspread by using the same toilet, clothing, cutl ery or bathroom as an infected person, as the \\nbacteria cannot survive for long outside the human body. \\nL.6.1.12 TRICHOMONIASIS \\nTrichomoniasis is an STI caused by a tiny parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis (TV). It can be \\neasily passed on through sex and most people don't know that they're infected. \\nIn women, trichomoniasis can cause a frothy yellow or watery vaginal discharge that has an \\nunpleasant smell, soreness or itching around the vagina, and pain when passing urine.  \\nIn men, trichomoniasis rarely causes sympt oms. You may experience pain or burning after \\npassing urine, a whitish discharge, or an inflamed foreskin. \\nThe parasite is usually spread by having unprotected sex (without using a condom), although \\nit can also be spread by sharing sex toys. You do not hav e to have many sexual partners to \\ncatch trichomoniasis. Anyone who is sexually active can catch it and pass it on. Trichomoniasis \\ncannot be passed on through oral or anal sex, kissing, hugging, sharing cups, plates or cutlery, \\ntoilet seats or towels. \\nL.6.2 WHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTH CARE FACILITY ? \\nAny person who is  at risk and doubts he might be infected, if had unprotected sex with a \\npotentially infected person or has been exposed to multiple sex partners  should always be \\nreferred  to the nearest sexual health cl inic or healthcare facility  for a check -up as soon as \\npossible. \\nSex workers should always be advised to have frequent regular check -ups. \\nL.6.3 REDUCING THE RISK OF STDS/STIS \\nEffective strategies for reducing STD risk include: \\nL.6.3.1 ABSTINENCE SEX \\nThe most reliable way to avoid infection is to not to have sex, especially anal and oral sex.  \\nL.6.3.2 MUTUAL MONOGAMY \\nMutual monogamy means to agree to be sexually active with only one person, who has \\nagreed to be sexually active only with the same person.  \\nBeing in a long -term mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner is one of \\nthe most reliable ways to avoid STDs.\"),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\FA-manual-1.pdf'}, page_content='288 \\nM.1 DEFINITION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL FIRST AID \\nIt is a process of facilitating resilience within an individual to enable to bounce back from the \\nimpact of crisis and help him to deal with the event/crisis by respecting the independence, \\ndignity and coping mechanism. \\nIn the past first aid was mainly focussed on giving physical first aid to an injured or suddenly sick \\nperson by someone who happens to be p resent when the accident happened or the illness \\noccurred. \\nTraumatic events and sickness may stress people. They might feel overwhelmed, worried, \\nconfused or feel uncertainness. Some people might show little or no signs, others might present \\nwith a more severe reaction.   \\nThe SPHERE (2011) and IASC (2007) define psychological first aid (PFA) as a humane, supportive \\nresponse to a fellow human being who is suffering and who may need support.  It includes: \\n\\uf0a7 providing practical care and support, which does not intrude; \\n\\uf0a7 assessing needs and concerns; \\n\\uf0a7 helping people to address basic needs (for example, food and water, information); \\n\\uf0a7 listening to people, but not pressuring them to talk; \\n\\uf0a7 comforting people and helping them to feel calm; \\n\\uf0a7 helping people connect to information, services and social supports, and \\n\\uf0a7 protecting people from further harm. \\nPhysical and psychological first aid go hand in hand and should be delivered simultaneously.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\FA-manual-1.pdf'}, page_content='289 \\nM.2 TRAUMATIC CRISIS \\n \\nA traumatic crisis is caused by a sudden, unexpected and intense incident.  \\nThe event, as in following examples \\n\\uf0a7 traffic accident, a fire, …; \\n\\uf0a7 natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, …); \\n\\uf0a7 serious illness; \\n\\uf0a7 death of a close one; \\n\\uf0a7 violence, robbery, attack, rape …; \\n\\uf0a7 financial difficulties; \\n\\uf0a7 relational difficulties; \\n\\uf0a7 suicide (attempt); \\n\\uf0a7 etc, \\nproduces a significant emotional shock that temporarily overwhelms the individual . \\nThe traumatic crisis will almost always follow a certain pattern. One may say that the traumatic \\ncrisis can be divided into four phases: \\n1. (Psychological) Shock phase. \\n2. Reaction phase. \\n3. Processing phase. \\n4. Reorientation phase. \\nM.2.1 (PSYCHOLOGICAL ) SHOCK PHASE  \\nThe shock phase follows immediately after the event which triggered the crisis. During the shock \\nphase, the person is not yet able to comprehend the event that caused the crisis and may \\neven deny it. While some people in shock become completely paralysed, others behave in a \\nmechanical and cold way. Some people in shock may become strongly agitated; they may \\nscream or cry furiously. People may also alternate between paralysis and restlessness  states. \\nThe reactions of people in shock, such as apparent lack of feelings, may confuse the people \\nclose to them and even cause embarrassment or resentment.  \\nThe shock phase may include:  \\n\\uf0a7 denial,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\FA-manual-1.pdf'}, page_content='290 \\n\\uf0a7 emotional shutdown, \\n\\uf0a7 feeling surreal and like an outsider, and \\n\\uf0a7 shouting, crying and panic. \\nReactions during the (psychological) shock phase may seem scary and strange.  \\nM.2.2 REACTION PHASE \\nThe immediate danger is over. The person will slowly face the tragic incident and try to \\nunderstand what has happened. At the beginning of the reaction  phase, people might \\nexperience strange and unexpected sensations; for example, they may feel that the person \\nthey have lost is still around or they may hear their voice somewhere.  \\nThe feelings of people in the reaction phase are often very similar to eac h other and they are \\noften expressed in the same form: \"I think I’m going crazy\", \"I can’t take it any more\", \"will I ever \\nmake it through?\", \"life feels like a rollercoaster\", or \"will this pain last forever?\", for example.  \\nThe reaction phase may include: \\n\\uf0a7 fear and anxiety, \\n\\uf0a7 self-accusations and the need to find someone to blame, \\n\\uf0a7 sleeplessness and loss of appetite, and \\n\\uf0a7 nausea or other physical symptoms. \\nDuring the reaction phase of a crisis, people often feel the need to be heard. They may feel \\nthe need to discuss the matter over and over again. This may feel very heavy and consuming \\nto the people close to the individual.  \\nM.2.3 PROCESSING PHASE  \\nIn the processing phase, the person begins to understand what has happened. The matter is \\nno longer denied; instead, the  person understands that the incident and all its changes and \\nlosses are really true. The person is ready to face all the different aspects of the incident and \\nthe new personal situation.  He is aware of the changes caused by the crisis and often begins \\nto analyse his own identity and personal convictions and beliefs. He begins to think beyond the \\nevent, but will not yet have strength to plan for the future. Nevertheless, the person is preparing \\nto face the future.  He also regains the capability to better concentrate on everyday life. \\nThe processing phase may include: \\n\\uf0a7 problems with memory and concentration, \\n\\uf0a7 irritability, and \\n\\uf0a7 withdrawal from social relationships. \\nM.2.4 REORIENTATION PHASE  \\nThe crisis is over. The person is able to live with what has happened, and it is no longer constantly \\non his mind. Every once in a while, the pain will resurface but there is also joy in life; the person \\nwill be able to look to the future and regain confidence in life. \\nNevertheless, the course of a crisis is not always straightfo rward; for example, things reminding \\nof the incident can bring back heavy thoughts, anxiety and other symptoms.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\FA-manual-1.pdf'}, page_content='291 \\nM.3 HOW DO I PROVIDE (PSYCHOLOGICAL) FIRST AID? \\n \\nLife-saving first aid is a top priority. It is important to start with limiting the physical inju ries. You \\nmust first and foremost give life-saving first aid where necessary, in order to make sure that the \\ninjured persons get to the hospital alive. Doing the best you can to limit the injuries as much as \\npossible also has a very soothing effect on the injured ones, and on all others present: ‘There is \\nsomeone who helps’. \\nM.3.1 BEHAVE CALMLY  \\nBehaving calmly has a very soothing effect on the casualties and the psychically affected \\npersons. Calmness can be just as contagious as uneasiness. \\nBehaving calmly is: \\n\\uf0a7 Speaking quietly in a normal pitch. \\n\\uf0a7 Focus the right amount of time on the person you are there to help, instead of \\nrunning from one thing to the other. \\n\\uf0a7 Showing clearly that you have time to take care of the affected person. \\n\\uf0a7 Avoiding mentioning that it seems to take too long for the ambulance or other \\nhelping teams to arrive. \\nM.3.2 LISTEN TO THE AFFECTE D PERSON \\nThe affected person must be given the opportunity to tell what he has experienced. This is \\ncalled “Venting”. \\nYou must accept what he tells you, and you must not comment on it; only ask questions which \\nmake him enlarge upon the subject.  \\nPerhaps his account sounds quite unbelievable, but to him that is what he has experienced or \\nthinks he has experienced. By telling about the experiences he gets a chance to recognize for \\nhimself that quite incredible things, which he thinks he has experienced and which make him \\nfrightened, are not true. This way he can get free of these fantasies.  \\nVenting experiences also has the result that he gets them sorted ou t and gets them placed in \\nthe proper succession in his memory. It makes it easier to endure having experiences emerging \\nas a tangled series of frightening pictures which he cannot control at all.  \\nYou should: \\n\\uf0a7 Try to find a quiet place to talk, and minimize outside distractions. \\n\\uf0a7 Respect privacy and keep the person’s story confidential, if this is appropriate.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\FA-manual-1.pdf'}, page_content='292 \\n\\uf0a7 Behave appropriately by considering the person’s culture, age and gender. \\n\\uf0a7 Respect the person’s right to make his own decisions. \\n\\uf0a7 Stay near the person but  keep an appropriate distance depending on their age, \\ngender and culture. \\n\\uf0a7 Let them know you are listening; for example, nod your head or say “ hmmmm….” \\n\\uf0a7 Be patient and stay calm. \\n\\uf0a7 Be honest and trustworthy. \\n\\uf0a7 Provide only factual correct information, if you ha ve it. Be honest about what you \\nknow and don’t know. Say “I don’t know, but I will try to find out about that for you.” \\nif you can’t answer the question.  \\n\\uf0a7 Give information in a way the person can understand and keep it. \\n\\uf0a7 Acknowledge how he is feeling. \\n\\uf0a7 If he tells you about any losses or important events, such as loss of the home or \\ndeath of a loved one, reply with “I’m so sorry. I can imagine this is very sad for you.” \\n\\uf0a7 Acknowledge the person’s strengths and how he has helped himself. \\n\\uf0a7 Allow for silence. \\n\\uf0a7 Make it clear to people that even if they refuse help now, they can still access help \\nin the future. \\nM.3.3 GENERAL CONSIDERATION  WHEN GIVING HELP  \\nConsider following basic topics when providing help or when you ask bystanders to give help:  \\n\\uf0a7 Get his personal belongings gathered. \\n\\uf0a7 Find out where he is going. \\n\\uf0a7 Find out how he got there. \\n\\uf0a7 Make sure that there is someone who can take care of the affected one when he \\narrives at the destination. \\nM.3.4 PHYSICAL CONTACT \\nIt helps incredibly and creates an immediate sense of security, if y ou take the hand of the \\naffected person or put an arm around his shoulder while you listen to him. If he cries - which in \\nitself is very good for him - you can allow him to put his head on your shoulder. \\nPhysical contact is so important because the affecte d person unconsciously will try to protect \\nhimself from the violent psychic trauma by reacting like a child. For this reason contact with a \\n\"grown-up\" helper may help him to feel more secure.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\FA-manual-1.pdf'}, page_content='293 \\nM.3.5 ALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE “HAVE A GOOD CRY ” \\nCrying is a strong outburst of feeling and a means of getting rid of extremely oppressive feelings. \\nIt is therefore very important to cry when the urge to do so arises. \\nBut crying is also very visible and audible expression of being affected by strong feelings and \\nfor some r eason this is considered \"embarrassing\" in many culture. It is necessary that we set \\naside our culture constraints; when you are giving psychological first aid the affected person \\nshould be allowed to give way to his feelings. Tell him you understand this.  \\nM.3.6 PROTECT AGAINST INQUI SITIVE ONLOOKERS  \\nThe affected person will be embarrassed showing his feelings, and he will, altogether, feel sorry \\nto let other people see him in this particular situation. \\nA person may react on the onlookers in different ways. He may try to hide himself in an \"ostrich \\nlike\" manner by holding his hands in front of his face, but he may just as well react very \\naggressively and abuse them. \\nYour help must consist in getting the affected one away from the onlookers, or make them \\nleave the area. \\nM.3.7 DO NOT LET THE AFFECT ED PERSON BE ALONE  \\nEven if the affected person does not like to have people around him, it is not a good idea to \\nleave him alone with his psychic crisis. His feelings will seem much more oppressive when he is \\nalone with them. \\nYou have to make sure that someone else can stay with him, if you cannot continue to provide \\nhelp. It is important that the person who stays with him knows what has happened, and what \\nthe situation is. It will also be of great advantage, if the helper who takes over, knows the basics \\nof psychological first aid and provides the best humane support. \\nM.3.8 PROVIDING PSYCHOLOGIC AL FIRST AID TO ALL  \\nThis means giving immediate emotional support to those who are physically injured, as well as \\nto those who are not physically injured but might be psychologically impacted.  \\nAlso, look after the confused, the lost, and those who are separated from families. Care for \\nthose who are left behind. Help them to be re-united with their relatives.  \\nRecovering from a psychological injur y can take longer than recovering from a wound. The \\nperson may need your continuing support in the weeks ahead \\nWhen there are mass casualties follow the instructions of the medical team in charge.  \\nM.3.9 DON’T FORGET TO TAKE CAR E OF YOURSELF  \\nHelping responsibly also means taking care of your own health and wellbeing.  \\nAs a helper, you may be affected by what you experience in a crisis situation, or you or your \\nfamily may be directly affected by the event. It is important to pay extra attention to your own \\nwellbeing and be sure that you are physically and emotionally able to help others. Take care \\nof yourself so that you can care best for others.  \\nIf working in a team, be aware of the wellbeing of your fellow helpers as well.'),\n",

Usually these are only minor bruises \\nand grazes, but sometimes the child may incur a severe accident resulting in fracture, \\nbleeding, suffocation, fainting, burns, drowning or electric shock (etc.).   \\nAlso, a school staff member may suffer a heart attack or a respiratory disorder with which first \\naiders have to cope.  \\nUnder these circumstances the first aider should be able to rise to the occasion, instead of \\ngetting nervous. There are several simple procedures anyone can learn and, if correctly and \\nimmediately applied, can make the difference between life and death.  \\nChildren are liable to the same type of emergencies and injuries as adults in similar \\ncircumstances. Details on how to handle emergency c ases are described in the various \\nchapters of this training programme. The procedure of attending an emergency always \\nremains the same and includes the following: \\n1. Assess the situation. \\n2. Safety first. \\n3. Alert and seek help. \\n4. Provide first-aid. \\n5. Transport or refer to a healthcare facility, if needed. \\n6. Hygiene. \\nTraining and exercising helps the first aider to act swiftly, calmly and in the correct way. There \\nis no substitute for proper training! \\nThe school management should ensure that: \\n\\uf0a7 a well-equipped first aid room or station with the necessary materials is available, \\n\\uf0a7 a trained first aider(s) is(are) available in the school or is on call, and \\n\\uf0a7 in each class at least one child (preferably more) is trained in first aid. \\nHaving trained first aiders available is a great asset to the school at the time of emergency.  \\nIt is again underlined that there is no substitute for proper training.

This can result in twisted lim bs, lacerations, severe bleeding and fractures, and \\nmay lead to shock.   \\nIn some cases it is not possible to extricate or release the victim easily. In all cases, the \\nmachinery should be stopped immediately, the power of the machine cut off and a person \\nwho is familiar with handling the machine or a senior foreman should be called to the scene.  \\nMost modern machines have automatic releasing devices. Eventually, machine parts may \\nhave to be dismantled to get access and release the casualty.  \\nThe first aider must assess the situation, ensure the safety for himself and casualty, control any \\nbleeding, provide the necessary first aid, prevent shock and reassure the casualty.

They may also feel that they will have to bear the expenditure of the \\ntransportation.  \\nThis thinking is not correct. A person who is lying he lpless can be relieved from sufferings if \\nsomeone provides the appropriate first aid and transport him to the nearest medical facility. \\nEven a little knowledge of first aid of trained laypeople can save lives.  \\nTo overcome this difficulty and to create publ ic awareness of the moral duty to help, the \\ngovernment, the court and the police have been issuing instructions via the press, posters and \\nradio- and TV-spots that members of public are to be given a positive response in their noble \\ntask helping and transporting the injured at the earliest to the healthcare facility or hospital for \\nfurther medical aid. Instructions have also been given to police staff to ensure that such persons \\nwho bring an injured to the hospital for medical aid are not be detained. It sh ould suffice for \\nthe emergency centres in hospitals to ask only following questions to the person who brings the \\ninjured to the hospital:  \\n1. Where have you brought this casualty from? \\n2. Do you know anything about the cause of the injury of the casualty? \\n3. May I have your particulars? \\nIt is likely that the person would answer the first question, but may not be able to answer the \\nsecond one. He might hesitate to answer to the third question, in which case it should not be \\ninsisted upon. The escorts should, under no  circumstances be detained in the hospital for \\ninterrogation. On the other hand he should be treated with courtesy. \\nHowever, rendering aid to the injured is the moral and civil duty of each and every one of us.  \\nDetails on how to handle these emergency cases are described in the various chapters of this \\ntraining programme. The procedure of attending an emergency always remains the same and \\nincludes the following: \\n1. Assess the situation. \\n2. Safety first. \\n3. Alert and seek help. \\n4.

These incidents can cause huge \\nlosses from collapsed buildings, damaged crops to large number of human casualties . \\nSometimes disasters strike suddenly. \\nRendering of first aid to the victims affected by a disaster is a very important relief activity and \\nis a part of the first aid training programmes. Mass casualty management stresses the \\nimportance of the role of firs t responders and first aiders in disaster relief and counts on their \\npreparedness to respond to emergency situations. \\nIn recent years, there has been renewed realizations that the people who become victim of \\ninjury or sudden illness need not only immediate  attention but also proper medical care. Thus , \\nit is imperative that first aid training and practice should keep pace with modem medical \\nadvancements.  \\nUnfortunately, many human lives are lost or disturbed by disasters and accidents. These stressful \\nlife e vents should be supported by appropriate and timely psychological aid. It is very \\nimportant that someone is helping in making necessary arrangements, giving practical advice, \\nlistening to the grievances, assuaging the feelings and providing physical comfor t by being \\nwith them. It is also important to educate victims about stress reactions and where to refer to \\nfor further help. These tasks do not require a psychologist, but trained first aiders can assist \\nsupporting these victims. \\nFor smooth working at a disaster or mass casualty accident site the first aiders need to:  \\n\\uf0a7 Have the appropriate knowledge and training in first aid and disaster \\nmanagement. \\n\\uf0a7 Have the capability to think practically and be able to improvise, if required. \\n\\uf0a7 Obtain the full particulars nature of the accident or disaster and the affected site. \\n\\uf0a7 Coordinate with the appropriate governmental authorities. \\n\\uf0a7 Coordinate with other local agencies, other institutions or organizations. \\n\\uf0a7 List the resources (transport capacit y, available medical personnel, available  first \\nresponders and first aiders, stand by medical equipment, available medication \\nsupplies, available equipment and disaster relief materials,  etc.) he has at his \\ndisposal and have an estimate how fast he can mobilize these resources. \\n\\uf0a7 Obtain permission to act from the superior officer on site. \\n\\uf0a7 Survey the site, the situation and the security risks. \\n\\uf0a7 Survey the casualties. \\n\\uf0a7 Allot the priorities for treatment and transport of the casualties. \\n\\uf0a7 Provide the necessary assistance. \\n\\uf0a7 Treat and transport the casualties to the assigned medical facilities. \\n\\uf0a7 Submit a daily report to the concerned authorities and to his organization. \\n\\uf0a7 Submit on completion of the mission a detailed final report to the concerned local \\nauthorities as we ll as his St. John Ambulance Headquarters or to his Red Cross \\nSociety along with his observations and suggestions.'),\n",

In medicine, this is the process \\nof sorting casualties in order of priority for treatment and evacuation. Triage may take many \\ndifferent forms, and operates at a number of different levels. However, it aims to give the right \\ninjured the right care at the right time in the right place. \\nIn certain circumstances , this may also mean ‘doing the most for the most’. Originally \\ndeveloped for use in military conflicts, triage is equally applicable to civilian disasters and in \\nday-to-day emergency settings. Accurate triage allows correct identification of those \\ncasualties who need the most urgent intervention, as well as quickly and safely identifying those \\nwho can wait longer for treatment. The latter are the majority at a typical major incident. Triage \\nmay also be used to identify casualties who are so severely injured that they will not survive, or \\nwhose treatment will tie up resources that would be best used for other injured. \\nTriage is dynamic ‒ as the person’s condition progresses, so his/her need for intervention alters, \\nand the triage category will change. \\nThe casualties are classified in different categories: \\nCategory \\uf0e0 RED \\n(U1 or I) \\nYELLOW \\n(U2 or II) \\nGREEN \\n(U3 or III) \\nBLACK \\nUrgency Extremely \\nurgent. \\nFast treatment  \\nneeded. \\nConstant follow \\nup of breathing \\nand circulation \\nrequired. \\nNon urgent \\ntreatment. \\nDeceased. \\nInjuries Life-threatening \\ninjuries. \\nSevere. \\nNot immediately \\nlife-threatening. \\nLocalised \\ninjuries. \\nNon-life-\\nthreatening. \\nFatal injuries. \\nCondition Cardiac arrest. \\nHypoxia. \\nShock. \\nLife- threatening \\nbleeding. \\nRelatively stable \\ncondition. \\nBleeding under \\ncontrol. \\nBreathing. \\nWalking \\nwounded. \\nNo respiration. \\nNo pulse. \\nCPR \\nunsuccessful. \\nSurvival rate Low if no urgent \\nmedical \\ntreatment. \\nBetter if medical \\ntreatment \\navailable. \\nGood when \\ntimely medical \\ntreatment is \\nprovided. \\nHigh. None. \\nTransport Immediate \\ntransport when \\nstabilized with \\nmedical team \\nescort in \\nmedically \\nequipped \\nambulance \\nUrgent transport \\n(after RED) when \\nstabilized under \\nparamedic \\nobservation in \\nequipped \\nambulance \\nNon-urgent \\ntransport (after \\nRED, YELLOW) by \\nambulance or \\nany available \\ntransport (taxi, \\ncar). \\nPost mortem \\ntransport to \\nmorgue'),\n",

They are \\nvictims of the incident but seem not to be injured. \\n\\uf0a7 Inside each category, i.e. the categories RED and YE LLOW, all casualties of the \\nsame are again ‘categorized by urgency’. For example, casualties with difficult \\nbreathing in category YELLOW will be attended first before casualties in the same \\ncategory with a better condition. \\n\\uf0a7 Triaging is a snapshot of the moment the victim has been evaluated. Victims of one \\ncategory can move in between categories. For example, a person in category \\nGREEN was walking around, but due to an internal bleeding his condition \\ndeteriorates and he becomes a category YELLOW, even RED, d epending on his \\n‘new’ condition.  \\n\\uf0a7 In a mass casualty incident assigning the triage category is done very quickly. The \\ncategory ‘BLACK’ (deceased) may be assigned to all casualties that are not \\nbreathing without even a CPR attempt (as incident is so massive and there are too \\nmany casualties that have to be attended with very limited resources). When more \\nhelp arrives, and if the situation allows, these victims might be re-evaluated.  \\n\\uf0a7 In most mass casualty disasters, a zone for the RED (U1), YELLOW (U2) and G REEN \\n(U3), the deceased (BLACK) and non-wounded (BLUE) will be assigned.  \\n\\uf0a7 Always make sure somebody is also observing the casualties in the GREEN zone and \\nthe non-wounded (BLUE) as some signs and symptoms of an injury may only show \\nover time.'),\n",

These are made from flannel, calico and elastic net or special paper.  \\nIf you have no bandage available, you can improvise one from an everyday item; for example, \\nyou can fold a square of fabric, such as a headscarf, diagonally to make a triangular bandage, \\nand a roller bandage if further folded. A belt, tie or some other materials can also be used as \\nan improvised bandage. \\nBandages should be applied firm enough to keep dressing and splints in positi on, but not as \\ntight as to cause injury to the part or to impede the circulation of the blood. A bluish ting e of \\nthe finger or nails may be a danger sign indicating that the bandage  is too tight. Loss of \\nsensation is another sign; such bandages should be loosened or removed quickly. \\nO.2.1 TYPES OF BANDAGES  \\nThere are several types of bandages.  \\n\\uf0a7 Triangular bandages (also referred to as “master bandage”) can be used as large \\ndressings, or as slings, to secure dressings or to immobilize limbs. \\n\\uf0a7 Roller and crepe bandages secure dressings and support injured limbs.  \\n\\uf0a7 Tubular bandages hold dressings on fingers or toes or support injured joints.  \\nO.2.1.1 TRIANGULAR BANDAGES \\n \\nA triangular bandage is made by cutting a piece of calico about 100 cm square from corner \\nto corner giving two triangular bandages.  \\nIt has three borders.

A bluish colour shows that there \\nis a dangerous tightening of splints or plasters and therefore, free flow of blo od is \\nnot possible. \\n9. If the casualty is not wearing a coat, place a soft pad under the neck portion of \\nthe sling to prevent rubbing of the skin in that place. \\nO.2.1.2.2 COLLAR ‘N’ CUFF SLING \\nThis sling is only used to support the wrist. \\n \\nTo apply a collar-N-cuff sling: \\n1.

Prepare the stretcher; the soft bed of the canvas type of stretcher must be stiffened, \\npreferably by placing short boards across the stretchers, or long ones lengthwise on \\nthe canvas if only these are available. If no stretcher is available, a narrow shutter, \\ndoor or board of at least the same width and length as the person may be used. \\n2. Cover the stretcher with a folded blanket and then blanket the stretcher. \\nPlace pillows or pads in readiness on the stretcher in a position to support the neck, \\nand small part of the back. Those should be sufficiently large, but not too large, to \\npreserve the normal curves of the spine. \\n3. Whenever the casualty is to be moved or lifted he must not be bent, twisted or over \\nextended. One bearer must apply firm but gentle support to the head and face, \\nso as to prevent neck movement and another bearer must steady and support the \\nlower limbs to prevent trunk movement. This must be continued until the casualty \\nhas been placed on the stretcher. \\n4. When the casualty is not already lying on a blanket or rug. \\na. Place the blanket or rug on the ground in line with the ca sualty, and rolled \\nlengthwise for half its width. \\nb. While the two bearers maintain control of the head and lower limbs, other \\nbearers very carefully turn the casualty on to his side every precaution being \\ntaken against movement at the site of the fracture. P lace the roller portion of \\nthe blanket or rug close to the casualty's back and gently rolls him over the roll \\nuntil he is lying on his opposite side. Unroll the rolled portion of the blanket or \\nrug gently lowering the casualty on his back so that he lies on the centre of the \\nopen blanket or rug. The bearers at the head and at the lower limbs conform \\nto the rolling of the casualty throughout. \\n5. Loading the stretcher.  \\nThere are two methods of loading a stretcher- a standard method (when there is a \\nblanket under the casualty), and an emergency method (when there is no blanket \\nunder the casualty), in which case the stretcher can be pushed under the casualty \\nfor that it will be necessary for the bearer at the feet to keep his legs wide apart to \\nallow the stretcher to be placed between them. \\na. “Blanket lift” is the standard method for loading cases of fractures of the spine \\nwhen there is blanket under the casualty. \\nRoll the two edges of the blanket up against the casualty's side.  \\nIf poles of sufficient length and rig idity are available the edges of the blanket \\nshould be rolled around them.

When the clothing is insecure, a broad bandage \\nmust be placed round the body just below the shoulder for the bearers to \\ngrasp. \\n6. In the case of cervical injuries, place firm supports such as rolled -up blanket s or \\nsandbags on each side of the head to steady it. \\n7. Place a folded blanket in the hollow above the heels so as to relieve pressure on \\nthem. \\n8. Wrap the casualty. \\n9. If he is to be carried over rough ground, reduce his body movements to a minimum \\nby binding him firmly but not too tightly to the stretcher, with broad bandages. \\nThese should be applied round the pelvis, thighs and calves, and round the body \\nand arms, just above the elbows. \\n10.

The main reason for these different kinds of first aid manuals or guidelines \\nis the fact that they are not always based on scientific evi dence. This also means that they do \\nnot necessarily describe the most effective first aid techniques.   \\n  \\nThat is also the very reason why, in 2006, the Belgian Red Cross (Flanders) decided to harmonise \\nthe traditional European first aid guidelines and bas e them on research and international \\ndirectives.

Belgian Red Cross (Flanders) helped to formulate these \\ncontextualised guidelines in 2009, resulting in the publication of the African First Aid Manual \\n(AFAM).   \\n  \\nThe development of the Indian First Aid Guidelines (IFAG) was the logical next step.
